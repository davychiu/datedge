Tuberculosis
<br>
<br>
(1) Tuberculosis, also known as TB is one of the oldest diseases known to infect humans. It is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was first isolated by a German physician named Robert Koch in 1882 who received a Nobel Prize for this discovery. It is for this reason that TB is sometimes called Koch's Infection. TB usually affects the lungs (called pulmonary tuberculosis); although in up to one-third of cases other organs are involved.<br>

<br>(2) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the largest number of new TB cases in 2008 occurred in the South-East Asia Region, which accounted for 34% of incident cases globally. An estimated 1.3 million people died from TB in 2008. The highest number of deaths was in the South-East Asia Region, while the highest mortality per capita was in the African Region. TB in the United States is also a disease of young adult members of the HIV-infected immigrant, and disadvantaged / marginalized populations. The spread of the HIV epidemic has resulted in doubling or tripling of the number of reported cases of TB during the past 15 years. The number of cases in Romania also increased by two-fold due to the deterioration in socioeconomic conditions and health care infrastructure.<br>
 
<br>(3) TB is most commonly transmitted from a patient with infectious pulmonary TB to other persons by droplet nuclei from sputum, which are aerosolized by coughing, sneezing or speaking. The tiny droplets dry rapidly and may remain suspended in the air for several hours and may gain direct access to the terminal passages when inhaled.  The probability of contact with a case of TB, the intimacy and duration of that contact, the degree of infectivity of the case and the shared environment of the contact are all important determinants of transmission.<br>

<br>(4) The risk of developing the disease after being infected depends on several factors such as the individual's innate susceptibility to disease and level of function of the body's immune system. Clinical illness directly following infection is classified as primary TB and is common among children up to 4 years of age. This is commonly called as Primary Koch's Infection. This type is usually not transmissible but maybe severe and disseminated. However, if the disease is acquired later in life, the chance is greater that the immune system will contain it, at least temporarily. The majority of infected individuals who ultimately develop TB do so within the first year or two after infection. Dormant bacteria, however, may persist for years before reactivating to produce secondary or postprimary TB, which is infectious.<br>

<br>(5) Overall, it is estimated that ~10% of persons infected in their youth will eventually develop active TB. This risk, however, is greatly increased among HIV-infected persons. Reinfection of a previously infected individual, which is common in areas with high rates of TB transmission, may also favor the development of disease.<br>

<br>(6) Age is an important determinant of the risk of disease after infection. Among infected persons, the incidence of TB is highest during late adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence among women peaks at 25 - 34 years of age. In this age group, rates among women are usually higher than those among men, while at older ages the opposite is true. This maybe attributed to cigarette and tobacco smoking among men even at older age. The risk may increase in the elderly, possibly because of waning immunity and comorbidity.<br>

<br>(7) Tuberculosis bacteria enter the body when droplet nuclei containing microorganisms from infectious patients are inhaled. While majority of inhaled bacteria are trapped in the upper airways and expelled, a fraction, usually <10% reach the inner airways. They then multiply and cause a local lung infection. The body's immunity starts to function causing numerous cells towards the lung infection trying to contain the bacteria.<br>

<br>(8) About 2 - 4 weeks after infection, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction sets in trying to contain the multiplying bacteria. Eventually, lesions called tubercles are formed in the lung tissue. The delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is the body's tissue damaging response to these tubercles. Eventually, tissue death termed as necrosis will start at the center of these tubercles. This area of necrosis resembles that of a soft cheese. This is why TB is often associated with caseous (cheese) necrosis.<br>


<br>(9) At this stage, TB disease can present as cough, chest pain or shortness of breath. It can also have non-specific symptoms such as fever especially at night, weight loss, chills, body weakness and loss of appetite.<br>

<br>(10) During the process of healing, either spontaneously or in the presence of treatment, infected lung tissue can either completely go back to its previous state (normal looking) or may undergo scar formation called fibrosis. This fibrosis or scar tissue is often seen in chest x-ray of previously infected individuals.<br>

<br>(11) However, if the infection is extensive, the lesions tend to enlarge further. The walls of the airways as well as the blood vessels are invaded and destroyed giving rise to the cavities. These cavities are often seen in the chest x-ray as big empty circles usually located at the upper lungs. The destruction of the blood vessels causes the blood-streaked sputum seen in severe cases of TB.<br>

<br>(12) In the early stages of infection, the lymph nodes try to contain the infection causing them to enlarge. This is why patients with TB usually present with enlarged lymph nodes, usually in the neck. But if the infection is left untreated, it can spread through these lymph nodes or through the blood towards the other organs, hence giving rise to extrapulmonary TB (outside the lungs).<br>

<br>(13) In order of frequency, the extrapulmonary sites most commonly involved in TB are the lymph nodes, lining of the lungs also called pleura, kidneys, bones and joints and spinal cord (meninges).<br>

<br>(14) TB of the lymph nodes is usually more common in women and children and is usually diagnosed with biopsy. TB of the lung pleura is usually diagnosed through chest x-ray which reveals fluid in the patient's lungs causing increasing difficulty of breathing. Such condition is called pleural effusion. Treatment would consist of drainage of fluid from the lungs through a tube that is inserted at the patient's chest. This procedure is called chest tube thoracostomy.<br>

<br>(15) TB of the kidneys usually present with urinary frequency, painful urination or blood in the urine. TB of the bones and joints commonly affects the spinal vertebra because of its proximity to the lungs. It is often termed as Pott's disease. This often results to increase in the curvature of the spine. It may often lead to spinal cord injury later on causing paralysis of the legs. TB of the spinal cord (meninges) give rise to the popular disease called TB meningitis which is relatively more common to young children. It often presents as headache, mental changes, confusion, lethargy, altered sensorium and neck rigidity.<br>

<br>(16) Due to the severity of lung tissue damage and its extensive spread, TB disease warrants early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Diagnosis is usually done with high index of suspicion due to previous exposure and symptoms and through chest x-rays, analysis of sputum and skin tests. The skin test called PPD (purified protein derivative) is done to determine if the person is infected with TB. A positive PPD skin test after 48-72 hours indicates TB exposure.<br>

<br>(17) Patients infected with TB should undergo 6-month treatment with oral medications. Oral medications will include 3 - 5 combination drugs computed according to patient's weight. The duration of treatment may be lengthened depending on the severity of infection. Due to prolonged treatment, most patients stop in the middle of therapy causing reinfection and drug resistance in the future. To address such problem, WHO designed the DOTS program. A DOT (Directly-observed treatment short-course) is done by asking the patient to take the oral medications in front of a health practitioner. This is designed to ensure patient's compliance to treatment.</html>
