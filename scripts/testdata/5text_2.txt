Cardiomyopathy
<br>
<br>
(1) The human heart is composed of 4 chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium and left ventricle. Deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body enters the right atrium and passes through the tricuspid valve then to the right ventricle. Deoxygenated blood is then carried to the lungs where it is oxygenated and then back to the left side of the heart. From the lungs, oxygenated blood enters the heart on the left atrium, passes to the mitral valve then to the left ventricle and pumped to the rest of the body.<br>
<br>
(2) Heart activity is divided into 2 phases: the diastole and systole. During diastole or ventricle relaxation, the atrium pumps blood towards the ventricles by way of the valves. During systole or ventricle contraction, the ventricle pumps out the blood from the heart to the lungs or the different body parts. The right and left side of the heart functions simultaneously. Dysfunction results when the valves are blocked or the chambers fail to pump properly. The myocardium or heart muscles together with the different chambers may also fail to function properly once enlargement and hypertrophy sets in. Hypertrophy is defined as an abnormality in an organ or a tissue as a result of an increase in size (rather than increase in number) of the individual cells.<br>
<br>
(3) Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the myocardium that are non-inflammatory and are not associated with hypertension, congenital heart disease, valvular disease, or coronary artery disease. It is usually characterized by otherwise unexplained ventricular dysfunction.<br>
<br>
(4) Congestive or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of cardiomyopathy. It is defined as a diminution in the contractile function of the left, right or both ventricles in the absence of pressure overload, volume overload, or coronary artery disease. The loss of cardiac muscle function results in congestive heart failure. It is characterized by dilatation of both ventricles and by both right and left-sided heart failure.<br>
<br>
(5) DCM can be genetic or pregnancy-induced. Prolonged ethanol or alcohol abuse is the most common reversible cause of cardiomyopathy. Viral infection is also hypothesized but proof of cause is generally lacking. High doses of doxorubicin, a commonly used antitumor drug; and exposure to mercury, lead or high-dose catecholamines may result in irreversible DCM. Endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism; metabolic disorders like elevated calcium; and prolonged arrhythmias may also lead to DCM but can easily be reversed once the offending condition is resolved. Hemoglobin disorders like sickle cell anemia and genetic abnormalities may also lead to irreversible DCM.<br>
<br>
(6) DCM is characterized by progressive myocardium hypertrophy, dilation and contractile (systolic) dysfunction. The heart is usually heavy, weighing two to three times the normal and large and flabby, with dilation of all chambers. Most muscle cells are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei.<br>
<br>
(7) Chest pain may occur in the absence of obstructive coronary disease. The cause of chest pain may be excessive oxygen demands of an enlarged, thin-walled ventricle with high wall stress. DCM may occur at any age, including in childhood, but it commonly affects those 20 to 60 years old. It presents with slowly progressive congestive heart failure, but patients may slip precipitously from a compensated to a decompensated state. Death is usually attributable to progressive heart failure or arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is defined as loss of normal and regular rhythm of heart beat or contraction. The offending agent should be removed and at times, heart transplant is recommended.<br>
<br>
(8) DCM is diagnosed using any of the following: electrocardiography (ECG), chest x-ray, echocardiography (2D-echo), or cardiac catheterization. ECG may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy and heart blocks. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged heart, and congestion. 2D-echo may reveal dilated and poorly contacting left and right ventricles.<br>
<br>
(9) Restrictive cardiomyopathy is caused by infiltrative processes within the myocardium that result in stiffening of the heart muscle, which interferes with pumping action that usually results into right and left-sided heart failure. The restrictive cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases in which the composition of the myocardium has changed so that it becomes stiffer. The increased stiffness of the myocardium restricts left ventricular filling, reducing blood volume output and increasing left ventricular filling pressure.<br>
<br>
(10) It is a disorder characterized by a primary decrease in ventricular compliance, resulting in impaired ventricular filling during diastole, the contractile (systolic) function of the left ventricle is usually unaffected. The ventricles are of approximately normal size or slightly enlarged, the ventricular cavities are not usually dilated, and the myocardium is firm. Symptoms of both left and right-sided heart failure are present though the symptoms of right-sided heart failure are usually more prominent.<br>
<br>
(11) ECG may also show abnormalities. Chest x-ray may show signs of congestion with normal heart size because even when left ventricular systolic function fails in the later stages of the disease, the restriction to blood filling prevents cardiac dilatation. 2D-echo shows thickening of left and right ventricles though their size remains normal. The left and right atriums are both increased in size.<br>
<br>
(12) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is characterized grossly by hypertrophy of the ventricular wall, especially the interventricular septum. The interventricular septum is the wall between both right and left ventricle. It is characterized microscopically by disoriented and tangled myocardial fibers. It may result in left ventricular outflow obstruction, placing the patient in danger of syncope and even sudden death.<br>
<br>
(13) HOCM is a disorder in which the interventricular septum hypertrophies excessively. The hypertrophied septum and the mitral valve produce left ventricular outflow obstruction. During systole, a low-pressure zone may develop as blood flow accelerates through the narrowed area between the septum and the mitral valve, generating a Bernoulli Effect. Thus, the mitral valve is drawn into the septum leading to outflow obstruction. The septum itself shortens very little during systole. Because the septum does not shorten, it cannot thicken. Therefore, it is the mitral valve that plays the active role in creating the obstruction.<br>
<br>
(14) HOCM is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy, abnormal diastolic filling, and intermittent left ventricular outflow obstruction. The heart is heavy, muscular, and hypercontracting. It is primarily diastolic. The essential feature is massive myocardial hypertrophy without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern is said to be disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum as compared with the free wall of the left ventricle, frequently called asymmetric septal hypertrophy.<br>
<br>
(15) HOCM is also known to be genetic in origin with autosomal dominant expression. There is reduced chamber size and poor compliance due to the impaired diastolic filling of the massively hypertrophied left ventricle. HOCM is often associated with arrhythmias and is one of the most common causes of sudden unexplained death in young athletes. Patients usually complain of chest pain which may occur at rest and is not always related to exercise. Loss of consciousness or syncope usually occurs after exercise as a result of reduced left ventricular size and consequent increased obstruction in outflow.<br>
<br>
(16) ECG is almost always abnormal showing left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. 2D-echo establishes the diagnosis which reveals asymmetric septal hypertrophy with or without obstruction. There is no conclusive evidence that surgical relief of obstruction in HOCM may prolong life. Thus, medical therapy is used first in an attempt to improve symptoms.
