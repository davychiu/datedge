Leukemia
<br>
<br>
(1) The bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen are involved in hematopoiesis (blood production). These organs and tissues have been divided into myeloid tissue; which includes the bone marrow; and lymphoid tissue, consisting of the thymus gland, lymph nodes and spleen. The lymphoid stem cells give rise to the B cells and T cells of the immune system. The myeloid tissue gives rise to the different precursor cells called blast cells - including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, segmented forms, lymphoblasts, myeloblasts, promyelocytes, megakaryocytes, etc. The blast cells in turn give rise to mature red blood cells and white blood cells - the leukocytes, monocytes, platelets, neutrophils and erythrocytes that circulate in the body. Any precursor cells that predominate in the peripheral blood are considered abnormal.<br>
<br>
(2) Leukemia is a general term for a group of neoplasms of either lymphoid or hematopoietic cell origin that present with widespread involvement of the bone marrow, usually accompanied by the presence of large numbers of tumor cells in the peripheral blood. A neoplasm is any new and abnormal growth in the tissues that may be benign or malignant. The number of circulating leukocytes is often markedly increased. The bone marrow is diffusely infiltrated with leukemic cells, often with encroachment on normal hematopoietic cell development. Consequent failure of normal leukocyte, red cell and platelet production can result in anemia, infection or hemorrhage. Infiltration of leukemic cells in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and other organs is common. Generally, leukemias are categorized to acute or chronic.<br>
<br>
(3) Acute leukemias are characterized by a predominance of blasts and closely related cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. It is more common in children and is the most common malignancy of the pediatric age group. It has second incidence peak after age 60. There may be chromosomal translocation which is associated with poorer prognosis. Without therapeutic intervention, acute leukemia follows a short and precipitous course, marked by anemia, infection, and hemorrhage, and death occurs within 6 to 12 months. Acute leukemia may be lymphoblastic or myeloblastic.<br>
<br>
(4) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a predominance of lymphoblasts. It occurs most often in children and is the form of leukemia that is most responsive to therapy. It is further divided into subgroups based on differences in morphology, antigenic cell-surface markers, or rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain or T-cell receptor genes.<br>
<br>
(5) ALL encompasses a group of neoplasms composed of immature, precursor B (pre-B) or T (pre-T) lymphocytes referred to as lymphoblasts. The majority of ALLs are pre-B cell tumors that typically manifest as childhood acute leukemia with extensive bone marrow and variable peripheral blood involvement. The less common pre-T cell ALLs tend to present in adolescent males, often involving the thymus gland. Most cases occur before 15 years old with peak incidence in 4 years old.<br>
<br>
(6) Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is characterized by a predominance of myeloblasts and early promyelocytes. It is also called acute granulocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. It occurs most frequently in adults. It responds more poorly to therapy than does ALL. It is further classified into a number of subgroups based on morphology and cytochemical characteristics.<br>
<br>
(7) AML affects primarily adults, usually 15-39 years old. It is further subdivided into 8 categories depending on the degree of maturation of the cells. This classification is also helpful for the prognosis of AML. The diagnosis of AML is based on finding greater than 30% myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. More often, distinctive red-staining rodlike structures called Auer rods are present. AML is also associated with chromosomal translocation in chromosomes 5 and 7 or 5 and 17.<br>
<br>
(8) ALL and AML have same clinical features. Failure of hematopoiesis is manifested by anemia, neutropenia (decreased neutrophils), and thrombocytopenia (decreased platelets). It has abrupt stormy onset, most patients present within days to a few weeks of onset of symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue mainly as a result of anemia; fever, reflecting infection caused by absence of mature leukocytes; bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia; and bone pain and tenderness due to bone marrow expansion. Generalized lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and testicular involvement are more common in ALL than AML. Headache, vomiting, and nerve palsies are also more frequent in ALL than AML. Three factors have been consistently associated with a worse prognosis: less than 2 years old, presentation in adolescence or adulthood and presence of Philadelphia chromosome.<br>
<br>
(9) Chronic leukemias are characterized by proliferations of lymphoid or hematopoietic cells that are more mature than those of the acute leukemia. It has longer, less devastating clinical course than acute leukemia. Chronic leukemia can be lymphocytic or myelocytic.<br>
<br>
(10) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells (almost always B cells) with widespread infiltration of the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and other organs. The leukemic cells closely resemble normal mature peripheral blood lymphocytes. Leukemic cells are incapable of differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells. Peripheral blood contains increased small, round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. The cells are fragile and susceptible to mechanical disruption, frequently disrupted in the process of making the smear, producing so-called smudge cells. Leukemic cells diffusely infiltrate the bone marrow.<br>
<br>
(11) CLL is the most common leukemia in adults. It most often occurs in persons over age of 60 and more frequently in men. It is often asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they are nonspecific and include easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. CLL disrupts immune functions making the body susceptible to bacterial infection. The clinical course is indolent, often with few symptoms and minor disability for protracted periods. Generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and spenomegaly are common. CLL has tendency to transform to more aggressive neoplasms. Mean survival is 3 to 7 years; treatment relieves symptoms but has little effect on overall survival.<br>
<br>
(12) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or chronic myelocytic leukemia or chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells, the precursor cells of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. CML is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome. Leukemic cells consist of myeloid (granulocytic) precursor cells, including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, and segmented forms. There are small numbers of blasts and promyelocytes. There is marked reduction in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity in the leukemic leukocyte. Patients have splenomegaly and modestly enlarged liver and lymph nodes. In most instances, it terminates in an accelerated phase (blast crisis) signalled by increasing numbers of blast cells and promyelocytes.<br>
<br>
(13) CML is a disease primarily of adults between ages 25 and 60. The peak incidence is in middle-age group (ages 35-60). A characteristic finding is the presence of sea-blue histiocytes. Peripheral blood examination reveals marked leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count).<br>
<br>
(14) The onset of CML is insidious, and the initial symptoms may be quite nonspecific - easy fatigability, weakness, weight loss, and anorexia (decreased appetite). Symptoms are caused by mild to moderate anemia or by hypermetabolism owing to increased cell turnover. Sometimes the first symptom is a dragging sensation in the abdomen caused by the extreme splenomegaly or acute onset of left-upper quadrant pain caused by spleen destruction. The course of CML is one of slow progression, and even without treatment a median survival of 3 years can be expected. After a variable period averaging 3 years, some patients enter an accelerated phase, during which there is a gradual failure of response to treatment accompanied by increasing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Within 6 to 12 months, the accelerated phase terminates in a blast crisis just like in acute leukemia. CML can be controlled during the stable phase with low-dose chemotherapy, which, however, does not prevent progression to blast crisis.
