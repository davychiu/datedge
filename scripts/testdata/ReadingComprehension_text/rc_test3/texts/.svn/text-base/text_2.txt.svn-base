(1)Glucose is a six-carbon sugar used by the body as main source of energy. When we eat carbohydrates, it is broken down into glucose and carried throughout the blood stream (hence the term blood sugar) to be distributed to the different parts of the body. If energy is not needed such as during rest, glucose is transformed to its storage forms, such as glycogen and reserved for future use.<br>
(2)Glucose level is properly controlled by a balance of hormones from the pancreas. The pancreas contains the islets of Langerhans. Each islet contains five different cells, two of which are: alpha cells that secrete glucagon which raises glucose and beta cells that secrete insulin which lowers glucose. Proper balance between the action of these two hormones (insulin and glucagon) is necessary to maintain normal glucose levels. Hyperglycemia happens once glucose exceeds the normal level required leading to diabetes mellitus.<br>
(3)Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by an elevation of fasting blood glucose caused by a relative or absolute deficiency in insulin. DM can be separated into two groups: type 1 (formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 (formerly called non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).<br>
(4)Type 1 DM is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin caused by an autoimmune attack on beta cells. The body does not recognize the beta cells as its own and destroys it. For several years, this autoimmune attack leads to gradual depletion of beta cells. However, symptoms are abrupt and only appear when eighty to ninety percent of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point, the pancreas fails to respond adequately to ingestion of glucose, and insulin therapy is required to restore glucose control. This destruction of beta cells happens when there is both a stimulus from the environment (such as a viral infection) and a genetic determinant (mutation) that allows the beta cells to be recognized as "non-self."<br>
(5)The onset of type 1 DM is typically during childhood or puberty. There is abrupt appearance of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and polyphagia (excessive hunger), often triggered by stress or an illness. These symptoms are usually accompanied by fatigue, weight loss, and weakness. The diagnosis of type 1 DM is confirmed by a fasting blood sugar (FBS) greater than 126 mg/dL, commonly accompanied by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).<br>
(6)Ketoacidosis is the state wherein the body accumulates ketone bodies or ketones and the blood pH falls below normal causing acidosis which can lead to coma. Normally, our body relies on glucose as main energy source. If glucose is adequate, insulin enhances storage of fatty acids in adipose tissue for future energy use. Insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase to transform fatty acids to its storage form. If glucose is low or absent, fatty acids are broken down to form ketones for energy use. In type 1 DM, insulin is absent, thus, there is no stimulus for lipoprotein lipase to store fatty acids. The net effect is breaking down of fatty acids forming ketones. If left unopposed, ketone accumulation decreases blood pH leading to ketoacidosis which can be fatal.<br>
(7)In the past, the glucose tolerance test was used to diagnose DM. After an eight hour fasting, FBS is taken. The patient is then given 75 grams of glucose orally. Blood glucose concentrations will be determined at thirty minute intervals for the next three hours. Normally, FBS is less than 100 mg/dL, and rises less than 140 mg/dL after a glucose load. In DM, FBS is initially high (greater than 126 mg/dL), and rises to concentrations greater than 200 mg/dL after glucose load.<br>
(8)However, the glucose tolerance test gives many false-positive results because the test itself can be stress-inducing, causing release of the hormone epinephrine. This hormone decreases the release of insulin from the beta cells, thus, impairs the response to a glucose load.  At present, glucose tolerance test is used only when diagnosis is uncertain or to test for pregnancy-induced DM. For the general population, FBS is more commonly used as diagnostic tool.<br>
(9)Type 2 DM, the more common type, develops gradually without obvious symptoms. It is often detected by routine screening tests. Polyuria and polydipsia may be present for several weeks prior to diagnosis. Polyphagia may be present, but is less common. Type 2 DM patients have a combination of insulin resistance and dysfunctional beta cells but do not require insulin to sustain life. The metabolic alterations observed in type 2 DM are milder than type 1. Diagnosis is based on the presence of hyperglycemia (FBS greater than 126 mg/dL). It does not involve viruses or autoimmune antibodies. Type 2 DM is more likely to be hereditary than type 1.<br>
(10)Insulin resistance is the decreased ability of target tissues, such as liver, adipose tissue and muscles to respond properly to normal circulating concentrations of insulin. Insulin resistance may be characterized by uncontrolled liver (hepatic) glucose production, and decreased glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue. There may be normal or low insulin present but the body does not react to its presence. This is in contrast to type 1 DM where insulin is not just low but absent due to destruction of beta cells.<br>
(11)Obesity is the most common cause of insulin resistance. In the absence of a defect in beta cell function, non-diabetic, obese individuals can compensate for insulin resistance with elevated levels of insulin. Insulin secretion is 2-3 times higher in obese people than it is in lean ones. This higher insulin concentration compensates for the diminished effect of the hormone (as a result of insulin resistance), and restores blood glucose back to normal levels. However, if insulin resistance persists due to continuous obesity, insulin slowly decreases.<br>
(12)Insulin resistance alone will not lead to type 2 DM. Rather, type 2 DM develops in insulin-resistant individuals who also show impaired beta cell function. Insulin resistance and subsequent development of type 2 DM is commonly observed in the elderly, and in individuals who are obese, physically inactive, or in pregnant women. These patients are unable to sufficiently compensate for insulin resistance with increased insulin release.<br>
(13)Insulin resistance increases with weight gain, and diminishes with weight loss. Fat accumulation affects insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage organ for fats, but also a secretory organ. Adipose tissues produce regulatory substances: leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, which all contribute to the development of insulin resistance.<br>
(14)In type 2 DM, beta cells are dysfunctional because it fails to secrete enough insulin to correct the prevailing hyperglycemia. The natural progression of type 2 DM results in a declining ability to control hyperglycemia with endogenous secretion of insulin. Deterioration of beta cell function may be accelerated by the toxic effects of sustained hyperglycemia and elevated fatty acids. Ketoacidosis is usually minimal or absent in type 2 DM because the presence of insulin – even in the presence of insulin resistance – diminishes fatty acid breakdown.<br>
(15)Hyperglycemia and ketones are the hallmarks of untreated type 1 DM. DKA is treated by replacing fluid and electrolytes, followed by administration of low-dose insulin to gradually correct hyperglycemia without precipitating hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Since insulin is virtually absent in type 1, patients rely on exogenous insulin injected subcutaneously to control the hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.<br>
(16)In type 2 DM, the goal is to maintain blood glucose within normal and prevent long-term complications. Weight reduction, exercise, diet modification and oral medications (if necessary) correct the hyperglycemia. Insulin is used in cases of poorly controlled hyperglycemia despite oral medications.<br>
(17)Long-term complications of DM can be macrovascular or microvascular. Macrovascular complications affect the large blood vessels of the body causing stroke and heart diseases. The microvascular complications affect the small blood vessels of the body mainly in the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy) and nerves (neuropathy).<br>
