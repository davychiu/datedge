(1)The human immune system has an innate immune system and an adaptive immune system. The innate immune system was inherited from invertebrates and uses germ line-encoded proteins to recognize pathogens. Important components for the recognition of microbes by the innate immune system are recognition by germ line-encoded host molecules, recognition of key microbe virulence factors but not recognition of self molecules, and non-recognition of benign foreign molecules or microbes.<br>
(2)Adaptive immunity is found only in vertebrates and is based on the generation of antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes bringing both specificity and immune memory to vertebrate host defenses. It is characterized by antigen-specific responses to a foreign antigen or pathogen. A key feature of adaptive immunity is that following the initial contact with antigen (immunologic priming), subsequent antigen exposure leads to more rapid and vigorous immune responses (immunologic memory). The adaptive immune system consists of dual limbs of cellular and humoral immunity. The principal effectors of cellular immunity are T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes for humoral immunity.<br>
(3)The normal human body harbors a complex microbial ecosystem. Generally, these commensal organisms (referred to as the indigenous flora) are considered to be non-pathogenic or non-infectious. Commensal organisms are not truly parasitic, which live in, with, or on another organism, partaking usually the same food. Both species may be benefited by the association. Infection and disease may result, however, when the body is challenged by a known pathogen or when the body’s defense system is disturbed, allowing uncontrolled growth or invasion by the indigenous flora.<br>
(4)Microorganisms can interact with humans in several ways. Most indigenous organisms seldom cause disease. Many of the organisms normally found on the skin and mucous membranes are widespread but may cause disease in unusual settings such as when host defenses are significantly impaired or when artificial material such as a catheter or a prosthetic joint is present. Examples of these organisms are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species.<br>
(5)Some indigenous organisms may cause disease in other body sites. Many bacteria that normally exist in one body site may cause morbidity elsewhere. For example, alpha-hemolytic (viridians) streptococcus organisms are commensals in the oral mucosa but can cause endocarditis if they are inoculated into the blood and settle on a previously damaged heart valve. In addition, enteric aerobes and anaerobes, which normally exist in high density in the intestines, can cause peritonitis and abscess formation if the intestine is perforated and these bacteria spill into the abdominal cavity.<br>
(6)Transient organisms may cause disease. The body’s normal flora may allow the temporary growth of certain microbes, which disappear spontaneously but may cause disease while present. For example, patients with invasive meningococcemia first have tonsillar bacteria called Neisseria meningitides, but only a tiny fraction of patients ever develop systemic disease.<br>
(7)Pathogenic organisms usually cause disease. Most viruses, as well as Chlamydia and Rickettsia, rarely are isolated from humans except during or following an acute illness. Some pathogenic bacteria include Brucella and Salmonella species, Neisseria gonorrhea, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>
(8)The human body has many ways of defending itself from potentially pathogenic microorganisms through anatomic barriers, cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Anatomic barriers are integral in preventing infection. These include physical barriers such as intact skin and mucous membranes, as well as functional barriers such as the muscular protection of the glottis and urinary bladder. Herpetic whitlow occurs when broken skin comes into contact with herpes simplex virus. Similarly, nonsterile intravenous injection of drugs may allow skin flora to enter the bloodstream and lead to the development of endocarditis. Mechanical devices such as indwelling bladder catheters and endotracheal tubes allow the bacterial colonization of normally sterile sites; this colonization may lead to infection.<br>
(9)Cellular immunity consists of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. Neutrophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are phagocytic cells that are important for ingesting and killing microorganisms that breach normal body defenses. The process in which phagocytes engulf and digest microorganisms is called phagocytosis. When neutrophils are reduced substantially in number (a condition termed neutropenia), pyogenic bacteria and fungi that are commensals of the skin or gut such as Escherichia coli and Candida albicans can cause serious infections.<br>
(10)Functional abnormalities of neutrophils may result in syndromes of varying type and severity. For example, patients with chronic granulomatous disease, caused by deficiency of NADPH oxidase, are prone to infections by catalase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, many gram-negative bacteria and fungi. These infections start early in life and tend to be severe and recurrent. Conversely, patients with lazy leukocyte syndrome tend to have mild, easily treatable infections associated with the upper respiratory tract.<br>
(11)Monocytes and their tissue forms- macrophages are also important for the ingestion of pathogenic microbes as well as for the production of modulators of the immune system like cytokines, and interleukins. However, some microorganisms are resistant to macrophage killing. After phagocytosis, these bacteria may be protected from those antibodies that do not penetrate macrophages. Examples of these bacteria are Salmonella, Legionella, and Mycobacterium species.<br>
(12)Lymphocytes are the third component of the cellular immune system. T lymphocytes, or T cells, have many roles in modulating the activities of other T cells, monocytes and B lymphocytes, or B cells. Antigen-specific T cells are responsible for delayed hypersensitivity and for controlling infections caused by a variety of agents, including species of Mycobacterium, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus.<br>
(13)T cells are broadly divided into helper T cells (Th) cells and suppressor (Ts) cells based on their effect on the immune system in terms of augmenting or diminishing the immune response. Th cells like CD4 cells tend to up-regulate the immune response, and Ts cells like CD8 cells tend to down-regulate the immune response. T cells also play a pivotal role in the manifestations of autoimmune disease.<br>
(14)Humoral immunity consists of antibody-mediated immunity and complement system. Antibody-mediated immunity involves the production of antibody by activated B cells which are stimulated by exposure to the proper antigen and to Th cells to differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells essentially are factories for the production of immunoglobulins, which they excrete into their environment. Immunoglobulins facilitate phagocytosis and activate complement, thus resulting in a more rapid clearance of the antigen. The absence or profound deficiency of immunoglobulins leads to recurrent infections caused primarily by encapsulated bacteria like Hemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia.<br>
(15)The complement system, a cascading series of glycoproteins, tags foreign material to promote phagocytosis or directly damages or destroys infective organisms. Severe complement deficiencies may predispose individuals to infections. For example, the reduced production of one or more of the late complement components predisposes to overwhelming neisserial infections.<br>
(16)Microbial virulence factors are important in determining the likelihood of infection. To infect a host, microorganisms or their products must adhere to host tissue. Some microbes invade host cells or breach barriers to reach susceptible body sites and, along the way, avoid or overcome host defenses. In some situations like chickenpox or measles, microbes can easily infect otherwise healthy individuals who have normal host defenses but no prior exposure to the microbe.<br>
(17)Some microbes cause disease at the contact site with the host. An example is Giardia intestinalis, which is confined to the lumen of the small bowel and causes abdominal cramping and diarrhea.<br>
(18)Some microbes have a special ability to produce a toxin or virulence factor to cause disease. For example, a toxin elaborated by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for toxic shock syndrome.<br>
(19)In some situations, microbes work in groups to cause disease when an individual organism lacks an essential virulence or survival quality to act alone. An example is delta hepatitis virus, which can occur only in the presence of ongoing hepatitis B infection.
