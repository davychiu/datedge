Embryogenesis 
<br>
<br>
(1) The starting point for the production of a new individual by sexual reproduction is the fertilized egg, or zygote. Repeated mitotic divisions result in many cells that differentiate to form the tissues and organs of the developing individual or embryo. 
<br>
<br>
(2) Soon after an egg is fertilized, the single-celled zygote becomes two cells, the two divide into four, and so on. This process of cleavage partitions the egg substance into an increasing number of smaller cells, or blastomeres, each with an equal number of chromosomes. The cleavage divisions are unusual because they are not separated by periods of cellular growth; the zygote mass is the same at the end of cleavage as at the start. The size distribution of the cells and the kind of division are a function of the amount and distribution of the yolk. Cleavage is termed holoblastic when an entire egg cell divides, as in the frog, and meroblastic when only part of the cell divides, as in the chick. 
<br>
<br>
(3) As holoblastic cleavage occurs, as in amphibians, the cells become arranged in the form of a hollow ball, or blastula, within which a central cavity, the blastocoels, appears. Two major regions are evident, an upper animal hemisphere, or pole of small dark cells with little yolk, and an opposite vegetal hemisphere below, of larger, pale-colored cells rich in yolk granules. Between them is a marginal zone of medium-sized cells.

(4) As cells continue to proliferate, an inrolling or involution begins directly below the center of the gray crescent, a lightly pigmented area of the egg cortex important in guiding early stages of development. A slit forms, and the fold above it is the dorsal lip of the blastopore, derived from the crescent. The cells of the animal hemisphere move inward more rapidly than the larger, fewer yolky cells of the vegetal hemisphere. The slit extends laterally and downward and eventually forms a ring of involuting tissue, the blastopore, which moves over the yolk-laden vegetal hemisphere and increasingly encloses it. This process of overgrowth is called epiboly. 
<br>
<br>
(5) Once inside the embryo, the involuting cells move away from the blastopore and form the walls of an enlarging chamber, the archenteron (or gastrocoel), which is the cavity of the primitive gut. The infolding process is called invagination. As the archenteron enlarges, the blastocoel is gradually obliterated. This is now called the gastrula. Epiboly and invagination are accomplished without change in the overall mass of the embryo, indicating that growth plays no part in the process of gastrulation. When complete, the gastrula consists of an outer layer of ectoderm from cells of the animal hemisphere, and inner layer of endoderm called entoderm from cells of the vegetal hemisphere, and between these a third layer, mesoderm. Since the latter at this stage includes the presumptive notochord, it may be called chordamesoderm. 
<br>
<br>
(6) Most of the mesoderm invaginates by rolling over the lateral and ventral lips of the blastopore. However, the portion giving rise to the notochord moves inward over the dorsal lip and is preceded by the prechordal plate mesoderm of the head. These are the germ layers from which various tissues and organs will form. The ectoderm will produce the external covering of the body, the nervous system, and the sense organs; the endoderm provides the lining of the digestive tract, its glands, and associated structure; and the mesoderm gives rise to the supportive tissues, muscles, lining of the body cavity and other parts. 
<br>
<br>
(7) At the end of gastrulation, when all the endoderm is inside, the original egg axis has rotated about 90 degrees. The former lower end of the axis then at the completed blastopore, marking the posterior end of the future animal. The chordamesoderm cells indicate the dorsal region; and shortly after gastrulation the paired neural folds on the surface, forward from the blastopore, provide an external indication of the dorsal surface. 
<br>
<br>
(8) After gastrulation, major differentiation of the embryo begins. From the three germ layers there are outpocketings, inpocketings, thickenings, divisions and other changes that lead to the establishment of the organs and organ systems. The nervous system starts dorsally as a pair of neural folds. The ectoderm between these sinks down and the folds come together to form a neural tube, enlarged at the anterior end to become the brain. On either side, between the neural tube and ectoderm, a line of cells forms the neural crests that will produce the dorsal or sensory roots of spinal nerves to grow into the cord. Motor roots later grow out ventrally from the cord. The neural crests also contribute sympathetic ganglia, the Schwann cells of nerve fibers, pigment cells, and important cartilage elements of the brachial complex. 
<br>
<br>
(9) The early brain has three primary vesicles, the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. The forebrain produces the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon, and from the hindbrain the cerebellum and medulla oblongata are derived. A rounded optic vesicle grows laterally on either side of the forebrain and stimulates the ectoderm on the side of the head region to form a thickened lens vesicle that subsequently produces the lens of the eye. Meanwhile, the outer surface of each optic vesicle becomes concave by invagination and forms the retina. 
<br>
<br>
(10) The endoderm of the primitive gut becomes the inner lining of the digestive tract. Anteriorly, at the future pharynx, three outpocketings of the tract on either side meet three corresponding inpocketings from the side of the neck; these break through to form the gill slits. A single ventral outpocket, behind the pharynx, forms the liver bud that becomes the liver and bile duct. An inpocketing of ectoderm called stomodeum forms ventrally on the head region, and a similar one called proctodeum at the posterior end. In later embryonic life these break through to join the endoderm of the digestive tract, the stomodeum becoming the mouth cavity and the proctodeum becoming the anal canal, both lined by ectoderm. During larval life a ventral outpocket of the pharynx grows posteriorly and divides into two lobes. The anterior part gives rise to the larynx and trachea and the lobes to the lungs.

(11) During gastrulation, the mesoderm grows inward and penetrates between the ectoderm and endoderm. Cells in its middorsal part become arranged as a solid rod, the notochord, between the nerve tube and primitive gut, to serve as a supporting body axis. Prospective mesoderm at either side of the notochord grows down as a curved plate between the ectoderm and endoderm, and the two meet ventrally under the yolk-laden cells. The thin lower part of each plate called hypomere splits into two layers. The outer is applied to the ectoderm and becomes the parietal peritoneum, the inner surrounds the gut to make the visceral peritoneum and smooth muscle of the gut, and the space between the layers is the body cavity, or coelom. The upper most mesoderm called epimere at either side of the nerve tube and notochord forms a lengthwise series of segmental blocks or somites. Each somite differentiates into three parts: a thin outer part called dermatome becomes the dermis of the skin, a thick inner part called myotome gives rise to voluntary muscles, and nearest the notochord, a scattering of cells called sclerotome grow about the neural tube and notochord to form the vertebrae or axial skeleton. Between the ventral plates and the somites a third portion called mesomere is the forerunner of the excretory system and parts of the reproductive system.
