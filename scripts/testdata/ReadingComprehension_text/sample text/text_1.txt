Fibrous Proteins
<br>
<br>
(1) Proteins may be classified on the basis of their solubility, shape, biologic function, or three-dimensional structure. Proteins may also be classified based on their overall shape --- either globular or fibrous. Globular proteins are compactly folded, coiled polypeptide chains with axial ratios (ratios of length to breadth) of less than 10 and generally not greater than 3-4. In contrast, fibrous proteins have axial ratios greater than 10.<br>
<br>
(2) Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They have long parallel polypeptide chains with cross linkages at intervals forming long fibers or sheets. They are usually insoluble having many structural roles. Globular proteins have complex tertiary and sometimes quaternary structures which are folded into spherical (globular) shapes. They are usually soluble as hydrophobic side chains in the center of structure. They have roles in metabolic reactions.<br>

(3) Collagen and elastin are the most common fibrous proteins that serve structural functions in the body. For example, collagen and elastin are found as components of skin, connective tissue, blood vessel walls, sclera and cornea of the eye. Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which are obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary, structural elements. This is in contrast to globular proteins, whose shapes are the result of complex interactions between secondary, tertiary, and, sometimes, quaternary structural elements.<br>

(4) Collagen is the most abundant protein in humans. A typical collagen molecule is a long, rigid structure in which three polypeptides (referred to as alpha-chains) are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix. Although these molecules are found throughout the body, their types and organization are dictated by the structural role collagen plays in a particular organ. In some tissues, collagen may be dispersed as a gel that gives support to the structure, as in the extracellular matrix or the vitreous humor of the eye. In other tissues, collagen may be bundled in tight, parallel fibers that provide great strength, as in tendons. In the cornea of the eye, collagen is stacked so as to transmit light with minimum scattering. Collagen of bone occurs as fibers arranged at an angle to each other so as to resist mechanical shear from any direction.<br>

(5) The collagen superfamily of proteins includes more than twenty collagen types. The three polypeptide alpha-chains are held together by hydrogen bonds between the chains. These alpha-chains are combined to form the various types of collagen found in the tissues. The collagens can be organized into three groups, based on their location and functions in the body. They can be fibril-forming, network-forming or fibril-associated collagens.<br>
<br>
(6) Types I, II and III are the fibril-forming or fibrillar collagens. They have a rope-like structure. In the electron microscope, these linear polymers of fibrils have characteristic banding patterns, reflecting the regular staggered packing of the individual collagen molecules in the fibril. Type I collagen fibers are found in supporting elements of high tensile strength whereas fibrils formed from type II collagen molecules are restricted to cartilaginous structures. Type III collagen are prevalent in more distensible tissues, such as blood vessels. Type I is found in skin, bone, tendon, blood vessels, and cornea; type II is found in cartilages, intervertebral disks, and vitreous body; while type III in blood vessels, and fetal skin.<br>
<br>
(7) Types IV and VII form a three-dimensional mesh, rather than distinct fibrils and are thus called network-forming collagens. Type IV collagens assemble into a sheet or meshwork that constitutes a major part of basement membranes. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that provide mechanical support for adjacent cells, and function as a semipermeable filtration barrier for macromolecules in organs such as the kidney and lungs. Type IV is found in basement membranes, type VII is found beneath stratified squamous epithelia.<br>
<br>
(8) Types IX and XII are fibril-associated collagens which bind to the surface of collagen fibrils, linking these fibrils to one another and to other components in the extracellular matrix. Type IX is in cartilages and type XII in tendons, ligaments, and some other tissues.<br>
<br>
(9) Like other connective tissues, collagen also contains amino acids which are building blocks of proteins. Collagen is rich in amino acids proline and glycine, both of which are important in the formation of the triple-stranded helix. Proline facilitates the formation of the helical conformation of each alpha-chain because its ring structure causes kinks in the peptide chain. Glycine, the smallest amino acid, is found in every 3rd position of the polypeptide chain. It fits into the restricted spaces where the 3 chains of the helix come together. The glycine residues are part of a repeating sequence, Gly-X-Y-, where X is frequently proline and Y is often hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine. Hydroxyproline is important in stabilizing the triple-helical structure because it maximizes interchain hydrogen bond formation.<br>
<br>
(10) Defects in any steps of collagen synthesis can result in a genetic disease involving an inability of collagen to form fibers properly and less tensile strength. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can result from an inheritable deficiency of collagen-processing enzymes or from mutations in the protein sequences of collagen types I, III or V. The most clinically important mutations are found in the gene for type III collagen. Collagen containing mutant chains is not secreted, and is either degraded or accumulated to high levels in intracellular compartments. Because collagen type III is an important component of arteries, potentially lethal blood vessel problems occur. Defects in type I fibrils result in stretchy skin and loose joints.<br>
<br>
(11) Brittle bone syndrome or Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is heterogenous group of inherited disorders characterized by bones that easily bend and fracture. Retarded wound healing and a rotated and twisted spine leading to a humped-back appearance are common features of the disease. Type I OI is called osteogenesis imperfecta tarda which presents in early infancy with fractures secondary to minor trauma, and may be suspected if prenatal ultrasound detects bowing or fractures of long bones. Type II OI, osteogenesis imperfecta congenital, is more severe, and may die in utero or in the neonatal period due to lung problems. Severe OI have mutations in the gene for either pro1- or pro2-alpha-chains of type I collagen. The most common mutation occurs in glycine substitution as every 3rd amino acid thus preventing folding of the protein into a triple-helical structure.<br>

(12) In contrast to collagen, which forms fibers that are tough and have high tensile strength, elastin is a connective tissue protein with rubber-like properties which can be found in lungs, walls of large arteries and elastic ligaments. They can be stretched to several times their normal length, but recoil to their original shape when the stretching force is relaxed.<br>
<br>
(13) Elastin is an insoluble protein polymer synthesized from a precursor, tropoelastin, which is secreted by the cell into the extracellular space. There it interacts with a specific glycoprotein microfibril, such as fibrillin, which functions as a scaffold onto which tropoelastin is deposited. Mutations in the fibrillin gene are responsible for Marfan's syndrome.<br>
<br>
(14) Blood and other body fluids contain alpha1-antitrypsin (&#945;1-AT) that inhibits a number of enzymes that hydrolyze and destroy proteins. &#945;1-AT has the important physiologic role of inhibiting elastase - a powerful protease that degrades elastin of the walls of the lungs (alveolar walls), as well as other structural proteins in a variety of tissues. Most of the &#945;1-AT found in plasma is synthesized and secreted by the liver.<br>
<br>
(15) In the normal lung, the elastin promotes the expansion and instant recoil of the alveolar walls. Elastase degrades the elastin in the alveolar walls. &#945;1-AT opposes the action of elastase thus keeping the alveolar walls expanded to promote air exchange. If there is a deficiency of &#945;1-AT (such in &#945;1-AT gene mutation), there will be a destruction of the connective tissue of alveolar walls resulting to collapse of alveolar walls called emphysema. Smoking also promotes degradation of &#945;1-AT.<br>
