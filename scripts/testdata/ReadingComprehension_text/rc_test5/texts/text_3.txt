Gender Identity Disorder
<br>
<br>
(1) Gender identity is a psychological state that reflects a person's sense of being male or female. It develops in most persons by the age of 2 or 3 years and usually corresponds to one's biological sex. Gender role is the external behavioural pattern that reflects a person's inner sense of "I am a male" or "I am a female". Gender identity disorders involve the persistent desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the other sex and extreme discomfort with one's assigned sex and gender role.<br>
<br>
(2) According to the fourth text revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), gender identity disorder is a heterogenous group of disorders whose common feature is a strong and persistent preference for the status and role of the opposite sex. These disorders may be manifested verbally, or non-verbally, in cross-sex behaviour. The affective component of gender identity disorder is commonly referred to as gender dysphoria, defined as discontent with one's biological sex, the desire to possess the body of the opposite sex, and the wish to be regarded as a member of the opposite sex.<br>
<br>
(3) The extreme forms of gender identity disorder is collectively referred to as transsexualism which commonly involves attempts to pass as a member of the opposite sex in the society and to obtain hormonal and surgical treatment to simulate the phenotype of the opposite biological sex. A person with gender identity disorder may be attracted to persons of the opposite sex, of the same sex, or of both sexes or may not experience sexual attraction to others.<br>
<br>
(4) There are four major criteria for gender identity disorder: a strong and persistent cross-gender identification (not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex); persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex; the disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition; and the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.<br>
<br>
(5) Strong and persistent cross gender-identification in children is manifested by four or more of the following: (1) repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex; (2) in boys, preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire, in girls, insistence on wearing only stereotypical masculine clothing; (3) strong and persistent preferences for cross-sex roles in make-believe play or persistent fantasies of being the other sex; (4) intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex; and (5) strong preference for playmates of the other sex. In adolescents and adults, the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, frequent passing as the other sex, desire to live or be treated as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the other sex.<br>
<br>
(6) Persistent discomfort with his or her sex in children is manifested as follows: in boys, assertion that his penis or testes are disgusting or will disappear or assertion that it would be better not to have a penis, or aversion toward rough and-tumble play and rejection of male stereotypical toys, games, and activities; in girls, rejection of urinating in a sitting position, assertion that she has or will grow a penis, or assertion that she does not want to grow breasts or menstruate, or marked aversion toward normative feminine clothing.<br>
<br>
(7) There is also a sub-category called: gender identity disorder not otherwise specified which is reserved for persons who cannot be classified as having a gender identity disorder with the characteristics described above. Three examples are: persons with intersex conditions and gender dysphoria; adults with transient, stress-related cross dressing behaviour; and persons who have a persistent preoccupation with castration or penectomy without a desire to acquire the sex characteristics of the other sex.<br>
<br>
(8) Intersex conditions include a variety of syndromes in which persons have gross anatomical aspects of the opposite sex such as Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome and pseudohermaphroditism. In Turner's syndrome, one sex chromosome is missing (XO chromosome). The result is absence or minimal development of the gonads, and no significant sex hormones are produced. The sexual tissues remain in a female resting state. They often show other signs, such as webbed neck, low hairline margin, and short stature.<br>
<br>
(9) Klinefelter's syndrome patients (usually XXY chromosome) have a male habitus under the influence of the Y chromosome, but the effect is weakened by the presence of the second X chromosome. Although patients are born with a penis and testes, the testes are small and infertile, and the penis may also be small. Beginning with adolescence, some patients develop gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) and other feminine-appearing contours. Their sexual desire is usually weak. Many patients have a wide variability of psychopathology, ranging from emotional instability to mental retardation. In pseudohermaphroditism, infants are born with ambiguous genitals. This is considered an obstetrical emergency. Sex assignment is done based on the genitalsâ€™ appearance at birth. True hermaphroditism is characterized by the presence of both testes and ovaries in the same person.<br>
<br>
(10) Cross-dressing defined as dressing in clothes of the opposite sex is a gender identity disorder if it is transient and related to stress. If the disorder is not stress-related, persons who cross-dress are classified as having transvestic fetishism. An essential feature of transvestic fetishism is that it produces sexual excitement. Stress-related cross-dressing may sometimes produce sexual excitement, but it also reduces a patient's tension and anxiety. Patients may harbour fantasies of cross-dressing but act them out only under stress. Male adult cross-dressers may have the fantasy that they are female, in whole or in part. Cross-dressing is commonly known as transvestism and the cross-dresser as a transvestite. Cross-dressing differs from transsexualism in that the patients have no persistent preoccupation with getting rid of their primary and secondary sex characteristics and acquiring the sex characteristics of the other sex.<br>
<br>
(11) The category of preoccupation with castration is reserved for men and women who have a persistent preoccupation with castration or penectomy without a desire to acquire the sex characteristics of the opposite sex. They are clearly uncomfortable with their assigned sex and live a life driven by the fantasy of what it would be like to be a different gender. They may be asexual and lack sexual interest in either men or women.<br>
<br>
(12) In contrast to DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10 lists five gender identity disorders: transssexualism, dual-role transvestism, gender identity disorder of childhood, other gender identity disorders, and gender identity disorders, unspecified.<br>
<br>
(13) In transsexualism, the individual desires to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to make his or her body as congruent as possible with the preferred sex through surgery and hormonal treatment, the transsexual identity has been present persistently for at least 2 years and is not a symptom of another mental disorder or associated with chromosome abnormality.<br>
<br>
(14) In dual-role transvestism, the individual wears clothes of the opposite sex in order to experience temporarily membership of the opposite sex, there is no sexual motivation for the cross-dressing, and the individual has no desire for a permanent change to the opposite sex.<br>
<br>
(15) Gender identity of childhood is manifested by persistent and intense distress about being a boy or a girl, and a stated desire to be of the opposite sex, or insists that he or she is a girl or boy, respectively. The disorder is present before puberty for at least 6 months. The child may also present with the following: persistent marked aversion to normative gender clothing insistence on wearing stereotypical clothing of the opposite sex; and/or persistent repudiation of his/her anatomical structures.
