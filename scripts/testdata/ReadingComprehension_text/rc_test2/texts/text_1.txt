Oxidants
<br>
<br>
(1)	Oxidants, also called free radicals, are potential toxic oxygen species produced during metabolism or during environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke and radiation. These oxidants include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, peroxyl radicals and the very reactive molecule: hydroxyl radicals. Free radicals are responsible not only for deterioration of foods (rancidity) but also for damage to tissues causing cancer, inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis (accumulation of fats/plaques in blood vessels), aging, etc. Chemical compounds and reactions capable of generating oxidants can be referred to as pro-oxidants. One of the pro-oxidant reactions in the body is the peroxidation (auto-oxidation) of lipids (fats). Since the molecular precursor for the initiation process is generally the hydrogen peroxide product, lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction with potentially devastating effects.<br>
<br>
(2)	On the other hand, compounds and reactions disposing oxidants, scavenging them, suppressing their formation, or opposing their actions are called antioxidants. In a normal cell, there is an appropriate pro-oxidant: antioxidant balance. However, this balance can be shifted toward the pro-oxidants when production of oxygen species is increased greatly or when levels of antioxidants are diminished. This state is called oxidative stress and can result in serious cell damage if the stress is massive or prolonged.<br>
<br>
(3)	Free radicals are molecules with incomplete electron shells which make them more chemically reactive than those with complete electron shells. They have one electron too much or too less in order to be stable. In humans, the most common form of free radicals is oxygen. When an oxygen molecule becomes electrically charged or radicalized, it tries to steal electron from other molecules, causing damage to the cell. When a free radical attacks a molecule, it will then become a free radical itself, causing a chain reaction. Over time, such damage may become irreversible and may lead to cancer. Antioxidants contain polyphenols that have the property to neutralize free radicals without becoming free radicals themselves. When antioxidants neutralize free radicals by receiving or donating an electron they do not become antioxidants themselves because they are stable in both forms. Thus, antioxidants are chemicals that offer up their own electrons to the free radicals to prevent cell damage. However, when the antioxidant neutralizes a free radical it becomes inactive. Therefore we need to continuously supply our body with antioxidants.<br>

(4)	Antioxidants fall into two classes: (1) preventive antioxidants, which reduce the rate of chain initiation; and (2) chain-breaking antioxidants, which interfere with chain propagation. Preventive antioxidants include catalase and other peroxidases that neutralize metal ions. Chain-breaking antioxidants are often phenols or aromatic amines. The principal chain-breaking antioxidants are urate, vitamin E and superoxide dismutase. The latter acts in the aqueous phase to trap superoxide free radicals. Propyl gallate, butylated hydroxyanisole, and butylated hydroxytoluene are antioxidants used as food additives. Naturally occurring antioxidants include vitamin E (tocopherol), which is lipid-soluble; and urate and vitamin C, which are water-soluble. Other natural antioxidants are carotenoids, vitamin A, lutein, lycopene and selenium.<br>

(5)	Vitamin E strengthens the immune system by increasing lymphocyte proliferation in the body. It is the first line of defense against peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in the membrane phospholipids. There are eight forms of vitamin E: four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta). Alpha-tocopherol is the main source of vitamin E in European diet and gamma tocopherol in American diet. The phospholipids of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes possess affinities for Î±-tocopherol. The tocopherols break free radical chains in polyunsaturated fats producing a phenoxy free radical which can either react with vitamin C to regenerate tocopherol or with another phenoxy free radical to oxidize it to a non-free radical product. This non-free radical product will be conjugated and excreted in the bile. If it reacts in this manner, tocopherol is not recycled after carrying out its function but must be replaced totally to continue its biologic role in the cell. The antioxidant action of tocopherol is effective at high oxygen concentrations, such as the red blood cell membranes, respiratory tree and the retina. Tocopherol is dissolved together with fat and is liberated and absorbed during fat digestion. Vitamin E is present in almonds, wheat, corn, broccoli, soybean oils and other foods.<br>
<br>
(6)	Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) also prevents cancer growth.  A recent study shows that HIF-1 (hypoxia-induced factor-1) seen in cancer cells disappeared in mice that received vitamin C. HIF-1 helps free radicals in feeding cancer cells by converting sugar to energy. Vitamin C is present cereals, kiwi fruits, beef, poultry, fish, guava, oranges, parsley, and other fruits and vegetables.<br>
<br>
(7)	Carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) are yellow, orange, and red pigments synthesized by plants. They are precursors of vitamin A which is essential for normal growth and development, immune system function and vision. Vitamin A is found in 3 main forms: retinol (vitamin A1), 3, 4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2), and 3-hydroxy-retinol (vitamin A3). It is found in liver, sweet potatoes, carrots, milk, egg yolks, and mozzarella cheese.<br>
<br>
(8)	Carotenoids increase the expression of gene encoding for a protein called connexin which in turn facilitate communication between neighboring cells to maintain cell differentiation. If this communication is lost, cell differentiation is disrupted leading to cancer cell formation. Carotenoids also reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Carotenoids are absorbed together with fats in the diet.<br>
<br>
(9) Beta-carotene is active during low oxygen pressures. Conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A is decreased when body stores of vitamin A are high. However, a study showed that intake of beta-carotene increased lung cancer rates in male smokers. The cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine and colestipol can reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and these carotenoids. Omeprazole and lansoprazole, medicines used to increase gastric pH in cases of hyperacidity also decrease the absorption of beta-carotenes. Beta-carotene is found in foods that are orange in color, including sweet potatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, squash, apricots and mangoes.<br>
<br>
(10) Lutein neutralizes oxidants formed in the retina. They regulate the amount of blue light entering the eye therefore protecting it from light-induced oxidative damage. They are abundant in green, leafy vegetables such as collard greens, spinach and kale.<br>
<br>
(11) Lycopene is associated with significant reductions in the risk of prostate cancer. Lycopene is found in tomatoes, watermelon, papaya, and pink grapefruits.<br>
<br>
(12) Selenium is a mineral, not an antioxidant nutrient. However, it is a component of antioxidant enzymes. Plant foods like rice and wheat are the major dietary sources of selenium. The amount of selenium in soil, which varies across different regions, determines the amount of selenium in the foods grown in that soil. Animals that eat grains or plants grown in selenium-rich soil have higher levels of selenium in their muscle. It can also be found in meats, bread and Brazilian nuts.<br>
<br>
(13) Coffee is also an antioxidant. Its caffeine content increases the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine which can reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease. Chlorogenic acid is the prominent polyphenol in coffee which is a cancer fighting agent. Caffeic acid (caffeine) works together with chlorogenic acid to protect cerebral neurons to promote cell differentiation and normalize colon function. This combination is effective in halting breast cancer cells, liver cirrhosis, dementia, colon cancer, gallstones, and Alzheimer's disease. It also has trigonelline which has anti-adhesive and antibacterial properties preventing tooth decay.<br>
<br>
(14) Both green tea and black tea contain antioxidants. They contain a catechin named epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which helps the arteries relax and expand to prevent cardiovascular disorders. Green tea (from Camellia sinensis) reduces the levels of amyloid alpha in patients with diabetes making them less prone to cardiovascular diseases. Green tea also reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease and improves oral health as well.<br>
<br>
(15) Recent studies in the U.S. suggest that certain products interfere with antioxidant absorption such as dairy products which contain a milk protein called casein which has great affinity for polyphenols present in antioxidants therefore destroying their health benefits.<br>
