(1)	Hemeproteins are a group of specialized proteins that contain heme as a tightly bound prosthetic group. A prosthetic group is a tightly bound coenzyme that does not dissociate from the enzyme. The role of the heme group is dictated by the environment created by the three-dimensional structure of the protein. In hemoglobin and myoglobin, the two most abundant hemeproteins in humans, the heme group serves to reversibly bind oxygen.<br>
(2)	Hemoglobin is found exclusively in red blood cells, where its main function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the capillaries of the tissues. Hemoglobin A, the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four polypeptide chains – two alpha chains and two beta chains --- held together by noncovalent interactions. The oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin are regulated by interaction with allosteric (“other site”) effectors.<br>
(3)	Hemoglobin has a quaternary structure. The hemoglobin tetramer has two identical dimers, (&alpha;&beta;)1 and (&alpha;&beta;)2. The two polypeptide chains within each dimer are held tightly together, primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Ionic and hydrogen bonds also occur between the members of the dimer. In contrast, the two dimers are able to move with respect to each other, being held together primarily by polar bonds. The weaker interactions between these mobile dimers result in the two dimers occupying different relative positions in deoxyhemoglobin as compared with oxyhemoglobin.<br>
(4)	The deoxy form of hemoglobin is called the “T”, or taut (tense) form. In the T form, the two &alpha;&beta; dimers interact through a network of ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that constrain the movement of the polypeptide chains. The T form is the low oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. This results in deoxyhemoglobin.<br>
(5)	The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin causes the rupture of some of the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds between the &alpha;&beta; dimers. This leads to a structure called the “R”, or relaxed form, in which the polypeptide chains have more freedom of movement. The R form is the high oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. This results in oxyhemoglobin.<br>
(6)	Hemoglobin can bind four oxygen molecules –one at each of its four heme groups. The degree of saturation of these oxygen-binding sites on all hemoglobin molecules can vary between zero (all sites are empty) and 100 percent (all sites are full).<br>
(7)	Hemoglobin can be plotted in a graph using hemoglobin’s percent saturation with oxygen at the y-axis plotted against partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) at x-axis. This is the oxygen-dissociation curve. The partial pressure of oxygen needed to achieve half-saturation of the binding sites (P<sub>50</sub>) is approximately 26 mmHg for hemoglobin. The higher the oxygen affinity, the more tightly oxygen binds, the lower the P<sub>50</sub>.<br>
(8)	The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin is sigmoidal in shape indicating that the subunits cooperate in binding oxygen. Cooperative binding of oxygen by the four subunits of hemoglobin means that the binding of an oxygen molecule at one heme group increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining heme groups in the same hemoglobin molecule. This effect is referred to as heme-heme interaction. Although it is more difficult for the first oxygen molecule to bind to hemoglobin, the subsequent binding of oxygen occurs with high affinity. The oxygen-dissociation curve is steepest at the oxygen concentrations that occur in the tissues. This permits oxygen delivery to respond to small changes in pO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
(9)	The ability of hemoglobin to reversibly bind to oxygen is affected by the pO<sub>2</sub>, the pH of the environment, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and the availability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. These are collectively called allosteric (“other site”) effectors, because their interaction at one site on the hemoglobin molecule affects the binding of oxygen to heme groups at other locations on the molecule.<br>
(10) The sigmoidal oxygen-binding curve reflects specific structural changes that are initiated at one heme group and transmitted to other heme groups in the hemoglobin tetramer. The net effect is that the affinity of hemoglobin for the last oxygen bound is approximately 300 times greater than its affinity for the first oxygen bound.<br>
(11) The cooperative binding of oxygen allows hemoglobin to deliver more oxygen to the tissues in response to relatively small changes in the arterial pressure of oxygen. For example, in the lungs, the concentration of oxygen is high and hemoglobin becomes virtually saturated (or “loaded”) with oxygen. In contrast, in the peripheral tissues, oxyhemoglobin releases (or “unloads”) much of its oxygen for use in the oxidative metabolism of the tissues.<br>
(12) The release of oxygen from hemoglobin is enhanced when the pH is lowered or when the hemoglobin is in the presence of an increased partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. At lower pH, a greater pO<sub>2</sub> is required to achieve any given oxygen saturation. Both result in decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and, therefore, a shift to the right in the oxygen dissociation curve. The change in oxygen binding is called the Bohr Effect. Conversely, raising the pH or lowering the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> results in greater affinity for oxygen, and a shift to the left in the oxygen-dissociation curve.<br>
(13) The Bohr Effect reflects the fact that the deoxy form of hemoglobin has a greater affinity for protons than does oxyhemoglobin. An increase in the concentration of protons (resulting in a decrease in pH, lower pO<sub>2</sub>) causes these groups to become protonated (charged) and able to form ionic bonds (also called salt bridges). These bonds preferentially stabilize the deoxy form of hemoglobin, producing a decrease in oxygen affinity.<br>
(14) Human hemoglobin A (HbA) is just one member of hemoglobins. Each of these oxygen-carrying proteins is a tetramer, composed of 2 &alpha;-globin-like polypeptides and 2 &beta;-globin-like polypeptides. Certain hemoglobins, such as HbF, are normally synthesized only during fetal development, whereas others, such as HbA<sub>2</sub>, are synthesized in the adult, although at low levels compared with HbA.  HbA can also become modified by the covalent addition of a hexose. For example, addition of glucose forms the glycosylated hemoglobin derivative, HbA1c, which is used in blood sugar monitoring.<br>
(15) Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) also contains two gamma chains. In the first few weeks after conception, embryonic hemoglobin (Hb Gower 1), composed of 2 zeta chains and 2 epsilon chains, is synthesized by the embryonic yolk sac. Within a few weeks, the fetal liver begins to synthesize HbF in the developing bone marrow. HbF is the major hemoglobin found in the fetus and newborn, accounting for about sixty percent of the total hemoglobin in the red blood cells during the last months of fetal life. HbA synthesis starts in the bone marrow at about eighth month of pregnancy and gradually replaces HbF.<br>
(16) HbA<sub>2</sub> is a minor component of normal adult hemoglobin, first appearing about twelve weeks after birth and, ultimately, constituting about two percent of the total hemoglobin. It is composed of two &alpha;–globin chains and two delta-globin chains.<br>
(17) Under physiologic conditions, HbA is slowly and non-enzymatically glycosylated, the extent of glycosylation being dependent on the plasma concentration of a particular hexose. The most abundant form of glycosylated hemoglobin is HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Increased amounts of HbA<sub>1c</sub> are found in red blood cells of patients with diabetes mellitus, because their HbA has contact with higher glucose concentrations during the 120 day lifetime of red blood cells.<br>
