(1)	AIDS was first recognized in 1981 when there was an unexplained occurrence of Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in 5 previously healthy individuals. In 1984, Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found to be the etiologic agent of AIDS.<br>
(2)	The hallmark of HIV disease is a profound immunodeficiency resulting primarily from a progressive deficiency of the subset of T lymphocytes. This subset of T cells contains CD4 molecule in its surface which serves as a primary receptor for HIV. CD4 molecule is a protein on the T-lymphocytes responsible for helper function in the immune system. The co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are needed for efficient fusion and entry of HIV. When the number of CD4+ T cells declines below a certain level, the patient is at high risk of developing a variety of opportunistic diseases.<br>
(3)	HIV is an RNA virus whose hallmark is the reverse transcriptase enzyme that causes reverse transcription of genomic RNA to DNA. HIV binds with the CD4 molecule. Once the virus is present, it catalyzes the transcription of RNA to DNA. DNA translocates to the nucleus and is integrated to the host cell chromosome through the help of the integrase enzyme. Once the cell is activated, the DNA formed will bud off from the cell to infect other cells.<br>
(4)	HIV infection is unique among human viral infections. Unlike other viruses, once HIV infection has been established, the virus succeeds in escaping the immune responses and is virtually never eliminated completely from the body. HIV infection very rarely kills the host during primary infection. Rather, a chronic infection develops that persists with varying degrees of virus replication in the untreated patient for a median of ~10 years before the patient becomes clinically ill. It is this establishment of a chronic, persistent infection that is the hallmark of HIV disease.<br>
(5)	Initially, CD4+ T cells increase with the start of HIV infection. But as HIV progresses, the level of CD4+ T cells in the blood decrease progressively. Most patients are entirely asymptomatic while this progressive decline is taking place. In untreated patients or in patients in whom therapy has not adequately controlled virus replication after a variable period, the CD4+ T cell count falls below a critical level of <200/uL and the patient becomes highly susceptible to opportunistic disease. The case definition of AIDS includes all HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ T cell counts below this level. It is not uncommon for CD4+ T cell counts to drop as low as 10/uL or even to zero, yet such patients may survive for months or even years.<br>
(6)	HIV is transmitted by both homosexual and heterosexual contact; by blood and blood products; and by infected mothers to infants either during pregnancy or via breast milk.<br>
(7)	There are a number of different tests that can be used to diagnose HIV infection. The most commonly used tests are called HIV antibody tests. Antibodies are the body’s reaction to HIV. Standard antibody HIV testing can have two stages. The most commonly used initial screening test is either an enzyme immune assay (EIA) or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the EIA/ELISA test is negative, no additional testing is done. If the EIA/ELISA screening test is positive, that result must be confirmed with a more specific test called Western Blot. Rapid HIV testing using oral fluids or blood specimens are EIA/ELISA screening tests that provide results in 20 minutes. This kind of test has been shown to be highly accurate (99.5%) and comparable to the blood tests that are performed in a laboratory.<br>
(8)	There are three clinical categories of HIV infection. Category A consists of documented HIV infection and either any of these 3: asymptomatic HIV infection; persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes); or acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection.<br>
(9)	Category B consists of symptomatic conditions in an HIV-infected individuals not listed in category C and that meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) the conditions are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or (2) the conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection.<br>
(10) Category C consists of opportunistic disease conditions listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition such as candidiasis, invasive cervical cancer, coccidioiodomycosis, cytomegalovirus disease, HIV-related encephalopathy, herpes simplex, Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, recurrent pneumonia, toxoplasmosis of the brain, recurrent salmonella septicemia and wasting syndrome due to HIV.<br>
(11) Regardless of the portal of entry of HIV, lymphoid tissues are the major anatomic sites for the establishment and propagation of HIV infection. HIV can infect almost all organs of the body. The presence of very opportunistic diseases in the body is clinical clue to the diagnosis of AIDS.  Another debilitating complication of AIDS is HIV-related encephalopathy or the HIV-associated dementia or AIDS dementia complex. This happens once HIV has reached the brain. It is generally a late complication of HIV infection that progresses slowly over months though it can be seen even in patients whose CD4 counts are greater than 350/uL. A major feature of this entity is the development of dementia, defined as a decline in cognitive ability from a previous level. It may present as impaired ability to concentrate, increased forgetfulness, difficulty reading, or increased difficulty performing complex tasks. It consists of five clinical stages.<br>
(12) Stage 0 (normal) consists of normal mental and motor function. Stage 0.5 (equivocal / subclinical) consists of absent, minimal, or equivocal symptoms without impairment of work or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Mild signs may be present such as snout response, slowed ocular or extremity movements. Walking and strength are normal. Stage 1 (mild), patients are able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or activities of daily living but with unequivocal evidence of functional, intellectual, or motor impairment. Patients in this stage can walk without assistance. Stage 2 (moderate) consists of ability to perform basic activities of self-care but cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life. Walking is possible but may require a single prop. Stage 3 (severe) has major intellectual incapacity (cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, considerable slowing of all output) or motor disability (cannot walk unassisted, usually with slowing and clumsiness of arms as well). Stage 4 (end-stage) is nearly vegetative. Intellectual and social comprehension and output are at a rudimentary level. Patient is nearly or absolutely mute. Patient can be paralyzed with urinary and fecal incontinence.<br>
(13) Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is initiated and continued whenever necessary. Each drug acts on the different stages of HIV infection. Among these drugs, Zidovudine is the only drug that can be used alone. All the other drugs available should be used in combination with other drugs. Zidovudine is the only drug for prevention of maternal to fetal HIV transmission.<br>
(14) There are also adverse drug reactions for each medication that should be monitored while taking the drug. Didanosine may cause pancreatitis (swelling of pancreas) and abnormalities in the liver function tests. Zalcitabine also causes pancreatitis, liver enlargement and oral ulcers. Stavudine also causes pancreatitis, liver damage and neuromuscular weakness. Abacavir may cause fever and rash while Tenofovir can damage the kidneys. Delavirdine also causes skin rash and liver damage. Saquinavir, Indinavir and Ritonavir cause abdominal pain, increased blood sugar and fat redistribution. Indinavir may also cause kidney stones. Nelfinavir side effects present as diarrhea seen as loose stools. Amprenavir also causes damage to the liver and tingling sensations / numbness around the lips. Enfuvirtide on the other hand, may increase the rate of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients.<br>
