Emphysema
<br>
<br>
(1) The air that we breathe in passes through our nose to the trachea and then to the lungs. The lung airways - the main right and left bronchus - arise from the trachea then branch to give rise to progressively smaller airways. Progressive branching of the bronchus forms bronchioles, which are distinguished from bronchus by the lack of cartilage and submucosal glands within their walls. Further branching of bronchioles leads to the terminal bronchioles, which are less than 2 mm in diameter. The part of the lung distal or farther from the terminal bronchiole is called the acinus or the terminal respiratory unit; it is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 7 mm. An acinus contains the alveolus (alveoli - plural) which serves as the site of gas exchange. An acinus is composed of respiratory bronchioles which then proceed into the alveolar ducts, which immediately branch and empty into the alveolar sacs.<br>

(2) Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, accompanied by destruction of their walls, and without obvious fibrosis or scarring. In contrast, the enlargement of airspaces unaccompanied by destruction is termed overinflation. Emphysema is defined in terms of the anatomic nature of lesion. There are four major types of emphysema: centriacinar, panacinar, paraseptal and irregular. Of these, only the first two cause clinically significant airflow obstruction. Centriacinar emphysema is far more common than the panacinar form.<br>
<br>
(3) Centriacinar or centrilobular emphysema involves the central or proximal parts of the acinus, formed by the respiratory bronchioles, whereas the distal parts are spared. Thus, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus. The lesions are more common and usually more severe in the upper lobes, particularly in the apical segments. The walls of the emphysematous spaces often contain large amounts of black pigment. Inflammation around bronchus and bronchioles and in the septa is common. In severe centriacinar emphysema, the distal acinus may be involved. Centriacinar emphysema occurs in heavy smokers with resemblance to the so-called coal workers' pneumoconiosis.<br>
<br>
(4) Panacinar or panlobular emphysema contains acinus that is uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. It tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the bases. This type is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin (&#945;1-AT) deficiency.<br>
<br>
(5) Paraseptal or distal acinar emphysema contains acinus whose proximal portion is normal but the distal part is dominantly involved. The emphysema is more striking adjacent to the pleura. It occurs adjacent to areas of fibrosis or scarring, and is usually more severe in the upper half of the lungs. The characteristic findings are of multiple, continuous, enlarged airspaces from less than 0.5 mm to more than 2.0 cm in diameter, sometimes forming cyst-like structures.<br>
<br>
(6) In irregular emphysema, the acinus is irregularly involved, and is almost invariably associated with scarring. Thus, it may be the most common form of emphysema but is usually asymptomatic.<br>
<br>
(7) The most plausible hypothesis to account for the destruction of airspaces in emphysema is the protease-antiprotease mechanism. Homozygous patients with a genetic deficiency of the protease inhibitor &#945;1-AT have a markedly enhanced tendency to develop pulmonary emphysema, which is compounded by smoking. &#945;1-AT (which is present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages) is a major inhibitor of proteases, particularly elastase, secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung. The principal antielastase activity in the serum is &#945;1-AT and the principal cellular elastase activity is derived from neutrophils (other elastases are formed by macrophages, mast cells, pancreas and bacteria). Neutrophil elastase is capable of digesting human lung, and this digestion can be inhibited by &#945;1-AT. Neutrophils are normally sequestered in the lung more in the lower zones than in upper zones, and a few gain access to the alveolar space. Any stimulus (like smoking) that increases either the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung or the release of their elastase-containing granules increases elastolytic activity. Stimulated neutrophils also release oxygen free radicals which inhibit &#945;1-AT activity.<br>
<br>
(8) It is postulated that centriacinar emphysema in smokers is due to the smoke particles, influx of neutrophils and macrophages and increased elastase and decreased &#945;1-AT activity. In contrast, panacinar emphysema of &#945;1-AT-deficient individuals reflects total lack of antiprotease throughout the acinus and susceptibility to chronic low-level proteolysis from neutrophils in transit through the lung distribution. The predominantly lower lung distribution (where perfusion and neutrophils numbers are greatest) of panacinar emphysema is also consistent with this postulate. The upper lobe distribution of centriacinar emphysema also reflects a relative lack of serum &#945;1-AT delivery to this less perfused region.<br>
<br>
(9) The diagnosis and classification of emphysema is based on naked eye (for hand lens) examination of lungs fixed in a state of inflation. Panacinar emphysema, when well developed, produces voluminous lungs, often overlapping the heart and hiding it when the anterior chest wall is removed. The macroscopic features of centriacinar emphysema are less impressive. The lungs may not appear particularly pale or voluminous unless the disease is well advanced. Generally the upper two thirds of the lungs are more severely affected. Large apical blebs or bullae are more characteristic of irregular emphysema secondary to scarring.<br>
<br>
(10) The clinical manifestations of emphysema do not appear until at least one third of the functioning pulmonary tissues are incapacitated. Difficulty of breathing is usually the first symptom; it begins insidiously but is steadily progressive. In some, cough, expectoration or wheezing is the chief complaint, easily confused with asthma. Weight loss is common and may be so severe as to suggest a hidden malignant tumor. The patient is barrel-chested, with difficulty of breathing, and obviously prolonged expiration, and sits forward in a hunched-over position, attempting to squeeze the air out of the lungs with each expiratory effort. Patients have a pinched face and breathe through pursed lips. There is slowing of forced expiration.<br>
<br>
(11) There are other uncommon types of emphysema. Compensatory emphysema or compensatory hyperinflation is used to designate dilation of alveoli but not destruction of septal walls in response to loss of lung substance elsewhere. Hyperexpansion of a lung may follow after surgical removal of a diseased lung or lobe. Senile emphysema refers to the overdistended, sometimes voluminous lungs found in the aged. These changes result from age-related alterations of the internal geometry of the lung - larger alveolar ducts and smaller alveoli - that occur without loss of elastic tissue or destruction of lung substance.<br>
<br>
(12) Obstructive overinflation refers to the condition in which the lung expands because air is trapped within it.  A common example is subtotal obstruction by a tumor or foreign object.  Bullous emphysema refers to any form of emphysema that produces large subpleural blebs or bullae (spaces &gt; 1 cm in diameter in the distended state). They represent localized accentuations of one of the four forms of emphysema, are most often near the apex, sometimes in relation to old tuberculous scarring.<br>
<br>
(13) The entrance of air into the connective tissue stroma of the lung is called interstitial emphysema. In most instances, alveolar tears in pulmonary emphysema provide the avenue of entrance of air into the stroma of the lung, but rarely a wound on the chest that allows air to be sucked in or a fractured rib that punctures the lung substance may underlie this disorder. Alveolar tears usually occur when there is a combination of coughing plus some obstruction in the bronchioles, producing sharply increased pressures within the alveolar sacs. Common examples are children with whooping cough; patients with obstruction to the airways by blood clots, tissue, or foreign bodies or being artificially ventilated; and individuals who suddenly inhale irritant gases.
