Cloning
<br>
<br>
(1) A clone is a large population of identical molecules, bacteria, or cells that arise from a common ancestor. Cloning allows for the production of a large number of identical DNA. Cloning involves complicated steps in the DNA.<br>
<br>
(2) In the laboratory the broken strands of DNA can be covalently joined together by treating them with DNA ligase. In this way, foreign DNA can be linked to the DNA of plasmids or bacteriophages (bacterial viruses). The bacteriophages or plasmids that have foreign DNA built into them in this manner are called vectors. Usually bacteriophages insert DNA very efficiently into their host bacteria. A single bacteriophage DNA can be replicated approximately 100-fold or more per cell depending on the type of phage and its host.<br>
<br>
(3) A vector is a molecule of DNA to which the fragment of DNA to be cloned is joined. Essential properties of a vector molecule include: it must be capable of autonomous replication within a host cell, it must contain at least one specific nucleotide sequence recognized by a restriction endonuclease and it must carry at least one gene that confers the ability to select for the vector, such as an antibiotic resistance gene. Commonly used vectors include plasmids and bacterial and animal viruses.<br>
<br>
(4) Prokaryotic organisms contain single, large, circular chromosomes. Most species of bacteria also normally contain small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids ranging in size from 2-100 kb. They also can be amplified to approximately 20 copies per cell. Plasmids can also be introduced into bacterial cells, although less efficiently than phage vectors. Some plasmids can be used to introduce recombinant DNA into yeast cells. One usually tries to adjust experimental conditions so that only one plasmid or phage is introduced into a single cell. When that cell replicates on a plate of nutrient agar, it will produce millions of cells until a colony becomes visible to the naked eye. If cells are sufficiently diluted before they are spread onto the plate, each colony will consist of a clone derived from a single ancestral cell. If each cell originally contained only one copy of the phage or plasmid vector, each colony will contain recombinant DNA that is homogeneous. That is, each colony will contain cloned DNA.<br>
<br>
(5) Plasmids found in nature often carry genes that code for proteins that make their hosts resistant to antibiotics. These genes are used to select bacterial colonies that contain recombinant plasmids. Plasmids usually are able to carry much less foreign DNA than a bacteriophage lambda. Thus plasmid vectors mainly are used to obtain pieces of DNA (up to 3 kb in size) suitable for sequencing, to subclone larger DNAs carried by phage vectors, or to clone single expressible genes derived from complementary DNAs (cDNAs).<br>
<br>
(6) Vectors of bacteriophage lambda can accommodate up to 23 kb of foreign DNA. The amount of DNA that can be inserted depends on the amount of nonessential lambda genes that can be replaced and the total amount of DNA that can be packaged into a particle able to be covered with phage coat proteins. Some eukaryotic genomic genes have such long intervening sequences that their DNA may not fit into one phage head. For cloning these large genes, cosmid vectors are often used.<br>
<br>
(7) Cosmids contain only a small part of lambda DNA, the two cohesive ends (cos gene) that allow many DNA to be packaged into particles in vitro. As with bacteriophages, these particles are very efficient vehicles for inserting DNA into E. coli cells; however, unlike phages, they cannot make infectious particles in vivo. Cosmids can carry up to 40 kb of recombinant DNA. Once in the cell, cosmids behave more as plasmids do.<br>
<br>
(8) A recombinant gene library is made by digesting cDNA or genomic DNA with one or more restriction enzymes, ligating the fragments to a vector, and introducing the vector into appropriate bacterial or yeast cells so that each cell will contain single recombinant DNA. It is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism. There are two kinds of DNA library: the genomic libraries and cDNA libraries. Genomic libraries ideally contain a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome. In contrast, cDNA libraries contain those DNA sequences that appear as mRNA molecules, and these differ from one cell type to another. Cloned cDNAs lack introns and the control regions of the genes, whereas these are present in genomic libraries.<br>
<br>
(9) A genomic library is a collection of fragments of double-stranded DNA obtained by digestion of the total DNA of the organism with a restriction endonuclease and subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. The recombinant DNA molecules are replicated within host bacteria and the amplified DNA fragments represent the entire genome of the organism. Genomic DNA is much more complex than cDNA.<br>
<br>
(10) cDNA can be used as a probe to locate the gene that coded for the original mRNA in mixtures containing many unrelated DNA fragments. If the mRNA used as a template is a mixture of many different species, the resulting cDNAs are heterogeneous. These mixtures can be cloned to form a cDNA library. cDNA is made in the laboratory from mRNAs using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Unlike eukaryotic genome DNA, cDNA does not contain intervening sequences. A complete cDNA may contain all the information needed to synthesize an mRNA for a specific protein. If the cDNA or its vector is modified so that the recombinant DNA has all the sequences necessary for RNA and protein synthesis, one can synthesize in bacterial cells the protein encoded in the recombinant cDNA. Such a vector is called an expression vector.<br>
<br> 
(11) Expression vectors can be used to obtain large quantities of protein that might be very difficult to isolate by conventional techniques. These special plasmids contain a bacterial promoter for transcription of the cDNA, and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence that allows the bacterial ribosome to initiate translation of the resulting mRNA molecule. This is possible because bacterial cells contain many copies of the recombinant gene and because RNA and protein synthesis occur very rapidly in bacteria. cDNA libraries are not easy to make because of the inherent instability of mRNA compared to DNA and because reverse transcriptase prematurely terminates when copying long mrRNAs.<br>
<br>
(12) The human genomic DNA can be simplified using different methods. Using the pulsed-field electrophoresis, DNAs are separated using short pulses of current at alternating angles to the direction of movement of the DNA. There also protocols used to detect a particular DNA or RNA that has been resolved by electrophoresis. In Southern blotting, the gel is blotted to nitrocellulose paper and the DNA on the paper hybridized with a labelled DNA probe. If the procedure uses RNAs, it is termed Northern blotting while Western blotting refers to the detection of proteins immunologically.<br>
<br>
(13) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique for amplifying small amounts of DNA when only small amounts of human tissue or cells are available. One needs to know the sequence of the DNA in question. Using the sequence, one chemically synthesizes two oligodeoxyribonucleotides of approximately 20-25 residues that are complementary to each of the two ends of the DNA of interest. These are annealed (heated, then cooled slowly) to the ends and serve as primers for the in vitro copying of each DNA strand using a heat-stable DNA polymerase called Taq polymerase. The chemically synthesized primers are in excess so that when the reaction mixture is heated to 63<sup>o</sup>C, the DNA strands separate and reanneal with more primer on cooling. This process of heating, cooling, and synthesis can be repeated many times, and in the process the DNA fragment of interest is greatly amplified. PCR can be used to detect carriers of hemophilia A, for prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell disease, and for fetal sex determination, etc.
