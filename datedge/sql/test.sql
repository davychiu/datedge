INSERT INTO datedge_test (id, text1, text2, text3) VALUES (0, "Tuberculosis<br><br>(1) Tuberculosis, also known as TB is one of the oldest diseases known to infect humans. It is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was first isolated by a German physician named Robert Koch in 1882 who received a Nobel Prize for this discovery. It is for this reason that TB is sometimes called Koch's Infection. TB usually affects the lungs (called pulmonary tuberculosis); although in up to one-third of cases other organs are involved.<br><br>(2) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the largest number of new TB cases in 2008 occurred in the South-East Asia Region, which accounted for 34% of incident cases globally. An estimated 1.3 million people died from TB in 2008. The highest number of deaths was in the South-East Asia Region, while the highest mortality per capita was in the African Region. TB in the United States is also a disease of young adult members of the HIV-infected immigrant, and disadvantaged / marginalized populations. The spread of the HIV epidemic has resulted in doubling or tripling of the number of reported cases of TB during the past 15 years. The number of cases in Romania also increased by two-fold due to the deterioration in socioeconomic conditions and health care infrastructure.<br> <br>(3) TB is most commonly transmitted from a patient with infectious pulmonary TB to other persons by droplet nuclei from sputum, which are aerosolized by coughing, sneezing or speaking. The tiny droplets dry rapidly and may remain suspended in the air for several hours and may gain direct access to the terminal passages when inhaled.  The probability of contact with a case of TB, the intimacy and duration of that contact, the degree of infectivity of the case and the shared environment of the contact are all important determinants of transmission.<br><br>(4) The risk of developing the disease after being infected depends on several factors such as the individual's innate susceptibility to disease and level of function of the body's immune system. Clinical illness directly following infection is classified as primary TB and is common among children up to 4 years of age. This is commonly called as Primary Koch's Infection. This type is usually not transmissible but maybe severe and disseminated. However, if the disease is acquired later in life, the chance is greater that the immune system will contain it, at least temporarily. The majority of infected individuals who ultimately develop TB do so within the first year or two after infection. Dormant bacteria, however, may persist for years before reactivating to produce secondary or postprimary TB, which is infectious.<br><br>(5) Overall, it is estimated that ~10% of persons infected in their youth will eventually develop active TB. This risk, however, is greatly increased among HIV-infected persons. Reinfection of a previously infected individual, which is common in areas with high rates of TB transmission, may also favor the development of disease.<br><br>(6) Age is an important determinant of the risk of disease after infection. Among infected persons, the incidence of TB is highest during late adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence among women peaks at 25 - 34 years of age. In this age group, rates among women are usually higher than those among men, while at older ages the opposite is true. This maybe attributed to cigarette and tobacco smoking among men even at older age. The risk may increase in the elderly, possibly because of waning immunity and comorbidity.<br><br>(7) Tuberculosis bacteria enter the body when droplet nuclei containing microorganisms from infectious patients are inhaled. While majority of inhaled bacteria are trapped in the upper airways and expelled, a fraction, usually <10% reach the inner airways. They then multiply and cause a local lung infection. The body's immunity starts to function causing numerous cells towards the lung infection trying to contain the bacteria.<br><br>(8) About 2 - 4 weeks after infection, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction sets in trying to contain the multiplying bacteria. Eventually, lesions called tubercles are formed in the lung tissue. The delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is the body's tissue damaging response to these tubercles. Eventually, tissue death termed as necrosis will start at the center of these tubercles. This area of necrosis resembles that of a soft cheese. This is why TB is often associated with caseous (cheese) necrosis.<br><br>(9) At this stage, TB disease can present as cough, chest pain or shortness of breath. It can also have non-specific symptoms such as fever especially at night, weight loss, chills, body weakness and loss of appetite.<br><br>(10) During the process of healing, either spontaneously or in the presence of treatment, infected lung tissue can either completely go back to its previous state (normal looking) or may undergo scar formation called fibrosis. This fibrosis or scar tissue is often seen in chest x-ray of previously infected individuals.<br><br>(11) However, if the infection is extensive, the lesions tend to enlarge further. The walls of the airways as well as the blood vessels are invaded and destroyed giving rise to the cavities. These cavities are often seen in the chest x-ray as big empty circles usually located at the upper lungs. The destruction of the blood vessels causes the blood-streaked sputum seen in severe cases of TB.<br><br>(12) In the early stages of infection, the lymph nodes try to contain the infection causing them to enlarge. This is why patients with TB usually present with enlarged lymph nodes, usually in the neck. But if the infection is left untreated, it can spread through these lymph nodes or through the blood towards the other organs, hence giving rise to extrapulmonary TB (outside the lungs).<br><br>(13) In order of frequency, the extrapulmonary sites most commonly involved in TB are the lymph nodes, lining of the lungs also called pleura, kidneys, bones and joints and spinal cord (meninges).<br><br>(14) TB of the lymph nodes is usually more common in women and children and is usually diagnosed with biopsy. TB of the lung pleura is usually diagnosed through chest x-ray which reveals fluid in the patient's lungs causing increasing difficulty of breathing. Such condition is called pleural effusion. Treatment would consist of drainage of fluid from the lungs through a tube that is inserted at the patient's chest. This procedure is called chest tube thoracostomy.<br><br>(15) TB of the kidneys usually present with urinary frequency, painful urination or blood in the urine. TB of the bones and joints commonly affects the spinal vertebra because of its proximity to the lungs. It is often termed as Pott's disease. This often results to increase in the curvature of the spine. It may often lead to spinal cord injury later on causing paralysis of the legs. TB of the spinal cord (meninges) give rise to the popular disease called TB meningitis which is relatively more common to young children. It often presents as headache, mental changes, confusion, lethargy, altered sensorium and neck rigidity.<br><br>(16) Due to the severity of lung tissue damage and its extensive spread, TB disease warrants early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Diagnosis is usually done with high index of suspicion due to previous exposure and symptoms and through chest x-rays, analysis of sputum and skin tests. The skin test called PPD (purified protein derivative) is done to determine if the person is infected with TB. A positive PPD skin test after 48-72 hours indicates TB exposure.<br><br>(17) Patients infected with TB should undergo 6-month treatment with oral medications. Oral medications will include 3 - 5 combination drugs computed according to patient's weight. The duration of treatment may be lengthened depending on the severity of infection. Due to prolonged treatment, most patients stop in the middle of therapy causing reinfection and drug resistance in the future. To address such problem, WHO designed the DOTS program. A DOT (Directly-observed treatment short-course) is done by asking the patient to take the oral medications in front of a health practitioner. This is designed to ensure patient's compliance to treatment.", "Obsessive-Compuslive Disorder<br><br>(1)  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) manifests with recurrent obsessions or compulsions sufficiently severe to cause marked distress to the person. The obsessions or compulsions are time consuming and interfere significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities or relationships. A patient with OCD may have an obsession or a compulsion or both.<br><br>(2) An obsession is a recurrent and intrusive thought, feeling, idea or sensation. In contrast to an obsession which is a mental event, a compulsion is a behavior. A compulsion is a conscious, standardized, recurrent behavior, such as counting, checking, or avoiding. A patient with OCD realizes the irrationality of the obsession and experiences both the obsession and the compulsion as unwanted behavior. The completion of the compulsive act may not affect the anxiety and it may even increase the anxiety. Anxiety is also increased when a person resists carrying out a compulsion.<br><br>(3) The lifetime prevalence of OCD in the general population is 2 - 3%. It is the 4th most common psychiatric diagnosis after phobias, substance-related disorders and major depressive disorders.<br><br> (4) Among adults, men and women are equally likely to be affected, but among adolescents, boys are more commonly affected than girls. The average age of onset is about 20 years, although men have a slightly earlier age of onset. The onset of the disorder can occur in adolescence or childhood, in some cases as early as 2 years of age. Single persons are more frequently affected with OCD.<br><br>(5) Persons with OCD are commonly affected by other mental disorders. Mental disorders commonly involved are major depressive disorders, social phobia, alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders.<br><br>(6) Several theories are postulated on the development of OCD. These theories are divided to biological factors, behavioral factors, and psychosocial factors.<br><br>(7) The biological theory states that dysregulation of certain chemicals in the body cause OCD. Among these chemicals are serotonin and noradrenergic system. The biological theory also established a link between OCD and group A Î²-hemolytic streptococcal infection.<br><br>(8) The behavioral theory states that obsessions are conditioned stimuli. A relatively neutral stimulus becomes associated with fear or anxiety through a process of respondent conditioning by being paired with events that are noxious or anxiety-producing. Thus, previously neutral objects and thoughts become conditioned stimuli capable of provoking anxiety or discomfort.<br><br>(9) On the other hand, compulsions are established in a different way. When a person discovers that a certain action reduces anxiety attached to an obsessional thought, he or she develops active avoidance strategies in the form of compulsions or ritualistic behaviors to control the anxiety. Gradually, because of their efficacy in reducing anxiety, the avoidance strategies become fixed as learned patterns of compulsive behaviors.<br><br>(10) The psychosocial theory is supported by Sigmund Freud who originally conceptualized OCD from its previous term: obsessional neurosis. Freud postulated that OCD patients become invested in maintaining the symptoms because of secondary gain. For example, a male patient whose mother stays home to take care of him, may unconsciously wish to hang on to his OCD symptoms because they keep the attention of his mother.<br><br>(11) The psychosocial theory also explains the interpersonal dimensions in OCD patients. The relatives of OCD patients will accommodate the patient through active participation in rituals or significant modifications of their daily routines. Often, the family members are involved in an effort to reduce the patient's anxiety or to control the patient's expressions of anger.<br><br>(12) OCD patients may exhibit obsessions or compulsions or both. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and can cause marked anxiety or distress. These are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems. The person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action. The person also recognizes that the obsessional thoughts are products of his or her own mind and not imposed from without.<br><br>(13) Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, they are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent.<br><br>(14) At some point, except for children, OCD patients recognize that obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. These cause marked distress, are time consuming (takes more than an hour a day), and significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, or usual social activities or relationships. If the above symptoms are present without the influence of any substance, then the diagnosis of OCD is made.<br><br>(15) A patient is further subclassified as OCD with poor insight if for most of the time during the current episode; the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.<br><br>(16) Most patients diagnosed with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions - up to 75%. They usually recognize it as absurd and irrational. Patients suffering from OCD usually feel a strong desire to resist them. The symptoms of OCD are divided into 4 symptom patterns which may overlap and change with time.<br><br>(17) The most common symptom pattern is an obsession of contamination, followed by washing or accompanied by compulsive avoidance of the presumably contaminated object. The feared object is often hard to avoid, for example, dust. Patients may literally rub the skin off their hands by excessive hand washing. Although anxiety is the most common emotional response to the feared object, obsessive shame and disgust are also common. Patients with contamination obsessions usually believe that the contamination is spread from object to object or person to person by the slightest contact.<br><br>(18) The second most common pattern is an obsession of doubt, followed by a compulsion of checking. The obsession often implies some danger of violence, for example, forgetting to turn off the stove. The checking may involve multiple trips back into the house to check the stove, for example. The patients have an obsessional self-doubt and always feel guilty about having forgotten or committed something.<br><br>(19) In the third most common pattern, there are intrusive obsessional thoughts without a compulsion. Such obsessions are usually repetitious thoughts of a sexual or aggressive act that is reprehensible to the patient. Patients obsessed with thoughts of aggressive or sexual acts may report themselves to police or confess to a priest.<br><br>(20) The fourth most common pattern is the need for symmetry or precision, which can lead to a compulsion or slowness. Patients can literally take hours to eat a meal or shave their faces.<br><br>(21) More than half of patients with OCD have a sudden onset of symptoms. The onset of symptoms for about 50-70% of patients occurs after a stressful event, such as pregnancy or death. Because many persons manage to keep their symptoms secret, there is often a delay of 5 - 10 years before they seek consult. The course is usually long but variable; some patients experience a fluctuating course, and others experience a constant one.<br><br>(22) About one third of patients with OCD have major depressive disorder, and suicide is a risk for all patients with OCD. A poor prognosis is indicated by yielding to compulsions, childhood onset, bizarre compulsions, the need for hospitalization, a coexisting major depressive disorder, delusional beliefs, and the presence of a personality disorder. A good prognosis is indicated by good social and occupational adjustment, the presence of a precipitating event, and an episodic nature of the symptoms.<br>", "Acute Viral Hepatitis<br><br>(1) Acute viral hepatitis is a systemic infection affecting the liver predominantly. Hepatitis comes from the Greek word hepar- meaning liver.<br><br>(2) Almost all cases of acute viral hepatitis are caused by one of five viral agents: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV).<br><br>(3) Hepatitis A virus belongs to the picornavirus family. HAV has an incubation period of approximately 4 weeks. Its replication is limited to the liver, but the virus is present in the liver, bile, stools and blood during the late incubation period and acute preicteric phase of the illness.<br><br>(4) Icteric phase is the period where the patient experiences yellowing of the eyes and skin due to liver (hepatic) injury. This yellowing state of the body is also referred to as jaundice. The preicteric phase therefore, is the period immediately before the skin and eyes turns yellow.<br><br>(5) HAV is transmitted almost exclusively by the fecal-oral route. Person-to-person spread of HAV is enhanced by poor personal hygiene and overcrowding; epidemics, contamination of food, water, milk, frozen products and shellfish.<br><br>(6) Hepatitis B virus belongs to the hepadnaviruses. They replicate in the liver but can exist in extrahepatic sites. They are often associated with acute and chronic hepatitis and liver cancer. Unlike other hepatitis viruses, HBV has 3 different antigens expressed in its envelope.<br><br>(7) The envelope antigen expressed on the outer surface of the virus is referred to as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which indicates presence of hepatitis B infection in the body. After HBsAg disappears, antibody to HBsAg called anti-HBsAg becomes detectable, indicating recovery from the illness. In addition, anti-HBsAg is considered as the protective antibody. It is the antibody tested to determine the effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine and the body's immunity against hepatitis B. If the level of anti-HBsAg is low, a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given.<br><br>(8) The antigen expressed on the core of the virus is hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), and its corresponding antibody is anti-HBc. Anti-HBcAg is seen within the first 1 - 2 weeks after the appearance of HBsAg and before anti-HBsAg appears. Thus, anti-HBcAg indicates the gap or window period between the appearance of HBsAg and its anti-body anti-HBsAg. Anti-HBcAg therefore does not indicate active virus replication but hepatitis B infection in the remote past.<br><br>(9) The third HBV antigen is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) which reflects the degree of infectivity of the virus. Thus, HBs-Ag positive patients containing HBeAg is more likely to be highly infectious than HBeAg negative patients. Early during the course of acute hepatitis B infection, HBeAg appears transiently; its disappearance may be a harbinger of clinical improvement and resolution of infection. Persistence of HBeAg beyond the first 3 months of infection is predictive of chronic infection.<br><br>(10) Hepatitis B antigens have been identified in extrahepatic sites, including lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen and pancreas. Although the virus does not appear to be associated with tissue injury in any of these extrahepatic sites, its presence in these organs may explain the recurrence of HBV infection after liver transplantation.<br><br>(11) Most cases of HBV result from less obvious modes of nonpercutaneous transmission such as intimate (especially sexual) contact and perinatal transmission (i.e. mother to child through pregnancy). Other high risk groups include spouses of acutely infected persons, sexually promiscuous persons (especially promiscuous men having sex with men), health care workers exposed to blood, persons with repeated blood transfusions, prisoners, and family of chronically-infected persons.<br><br>(12) The hepatitis D virus or sometimes called delta hepatitis agent (HDV) requires the helper function of HBV for its replication and expression. HDV can either infect a person simultaneously with HBV (co-infection) or superinfect a person already with HBV (superinfection). Because HDV relies absolutely on HBV, the duration of HDV infection is determined by the duration of (and cannot outlast) HBV infection.<br><br>(13) HDV can be transmitted through blood, primarily injection drug users and hemophiliacs, and rarely through close personal contact. Infection is endemic among patients with hepatitis B.<br><br>(14) Hepatitis C virus, previously termed as non-A, non-B hepatitis is the only member of the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Unlike other viruses, HCV infection does not induce lasting immunity against reinfection.<br><br>(15) HCV is commonly transmitted through blood, sexual contact and perinatal transmission. HCV is prevalent among those undergoing dialysis and those receiving blood transfusion during cancer chemotherapy.<br><br>(16) Hepatitis E virus is previously labeled as epidemic or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis. The term 'enteric' refers to the digestive system route of infection, thus, Hepatitis E virus generally affects the digestive system of the body. It primarily occurs in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America. It was once thought to be related to caliciviruses. The virus has been detected in stool, bile, and liver and is excreted in the stool during the late incubation period.<br><br>(17) HEV is common after contamination of water supplies such as after monsoon flooding. In contrast to HAV, HEV is rarely transmitted person-to-person from infected persons to their close contacts.<br><br>(18) Acute viral hepatitis occurs after an incubation period that varies according to the responsible virus. Initial symptoms are systemic and quite variable. Constitutional symptoms of anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, body weakness, joint and muscle pains, headache, photophobia, sore throat, cough and colds may precede the onset of jaundice by 1 - 2 weeks. A low-grade fever is more often present in hepatitis A and E than in hepatitis B or C. Dark urine and clay-colored stools may be noticed by the patient from 1 - 5 days before the onset of jaundice.<br><br>(19) With the onset of jaundice, the constitutional symptoms may diminish. Some patients experience weight loss which may continue during the icteric phase. The liver may be enlarged and tender causing pain and discomfort in the right upper side of abdomen. Spleen enlargement may be present in some patients. During the recovery phase, constitutional symptoms disappear ranging from 2 - 12 weeks, but is usually more prolonged in acute hepatitis B and C.<br><br>(20) Virtually all previously healthy patients with hepatitis A recover completely from their illness with no clinical sequelae. Similarly, in acute hepatitis B, 95% - 99% of previously healthy adults have a favorable recovery. Patients of advanced age and with serious underlying medical disorders may have a prolonged course and are more likely to develop severe hepatitis.<br><br>(21) In hepatitis B, among previously healthy adults who present with clinically apparent acute hepatitis, recovery occurs in approximately 99%; therefore, antiviral therapy is not likely to improve the rate of recovery and is not required. In rare cases of severe acute hepatitis, treatment with Lamivudine has been successful.<br><br>(22) In typical cases of active hepatitis C, recovery is rare, and most patients progress to chronic hepatitis requiring anti-viral treatment with interferon alpha, which is still under further studies.<br><br>(23) Notwithstanding these specific therapeutic considerations, in most cases of typical acute viral hepatitis, specific treatment generally is not necessary. Although hospitalization may be required for clinically severe illness, most patients do not require hospital care. A high-calorie diet is desirable, and because many patients may experience nausea late in the day, the major caloric intake is best tolerated in the morning. Intravenous feeding is necessary if there is persistent vomiting and cannot maintain oral intake. Drugs that have harmful effects to the liver should be avoided. Physical isolation of patients to a single room and bathroom is rarely necessary except in cases of fecal incontinence.<br>");
INSERT INTO datedge_test (id, text1, text2, text3) VALUES (1, "Oxidants<br><br>(1) Oxidants, also called free radicals, are potential toxic oxygen species produced during metabolism or during environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke and radiation. These oxidants include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, peroxyl radicals and the very reactive molecule: hydroxyl radicals. Free radicals are responsible not only for deterioration of foods (rancidity) but also for damage to tissues causing cancer, inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis (accumulation of fats / plaques in blood vessels), aging, etc. Chemical compounds and reactions capable of generating oxidants can be referred to as pro-oxidants. One of the pro-oxidant reactions in the body is the peroxidation (auto-oxidation) of lipids (fats). Since the molecular precursor for the initiation process is generally the hydrogen peroxide product, lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction with potentially devastating effects.<br><br>(2) On the other hand, compounds and reactions disposing oxidants, scavenging them, suppressing their formation, or opposing their actions are called antioxidants. In a normal cell, there is an appropriate pro-oxidant: antioxidant balance. However, this balance can be shifted toward the pro-oxidants when production of oxygen species is increased greatly or when levels of antioxidants are diminished. This state is called oxidative stress and can result in serious cell damage if the stress is massive or prolonged.<br><br>(3) Free radicals are molecules with incomplete electron shells which make them more chemically reactive than those with complete electron shells. They have one electron too much or too less in order to be stable. In humans, the most common form of free radicals is oxygen. When an oxygen molecule becomes electrically charged or radicalized, it tries to steal electron from other molecules, causing damage to the cell. When a free radical attacks a molecule, it will then become a free radical itself, causing a chain reaction. Over time, such damage may become irreversible and may lead to cancer. Antioxidants contain polyphenols that have the property to neutralize free radicals without becoming free radicals themselves. When antioxidants neutralize free radicals by receiving or donating an electron they do not become antioxidants themselves because they are stable in both forms. Thus, antioxidants are chemicals that offer up their own electrons to the free radicals to prevent cell damage. However, when the antioxidant neutralizes a free radical it becomes inactive. Therefore we need to continuously supply our body with antioxidants.<br><br>(4) Antioxidants fall into two classes: (1) preventive antioxidants, which reduce the rate of chain initiation; and (2) chain-breaking antioxidants, which interfere with chain propagation. Preventive antioxidants include catalase and other peroxidases that neutralize metal ions. Chain-breaking antioxidants are often phenols or aromatic amines. The principal chain-breaking antioxidants are urate, vitamin E and superoxide dismutase. The latter acts in the aqueous phase to trap superoxide free radicals. Propyl gallate, butylated hydroxyanisole, and butylated hydroxytoluene are antioxidants used as food additives. Naturally occurring antioxidants include vitamin E (tocopherol), which is lipid-soluble; and urate and vitamin C, which are water-soluble. Other natural antioxidants are carotenoids, vitamin A, lutein, lycopene and selenium.<br><br>(5) Vitamin E strengthens the immune system by increasing lymphocyte proliferation in the body. It is the first line of defense against peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in the membrane phospholipids. There are eight forms of vitamin E: four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta). Alpha-tocopherol is the main source of vitamin E in European diet and gamma tocopherol in American diet. The phospholipids of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes possess affinities for Î±-tocopherol. The tocopherols break free radical chains in polyunsaturated fats producing a phenoxy free radical which can either react with vitamin C to regenerate tocopherol or with another phenoxy free radical to oxidize it to a non-free radical product. This non-free radical product will be conjugated and excreted in the bile. If it reacts in this manner, tocopherol is not recycled after carrying out its function but must be replaced totally to continue its biologic role in the cell. The antioxidant action of tocopherol is effective at high oxygen concentrations, such as the red blood cell membranes, respiratory tree and the retina. Tocopherol is dissolved together with fat and is liberated and absorbed during fat digestion. Vitamin E is present in almonds, wheat, corn, broccoli, soybean oils and other foods.<br><br>(6) Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) also prevents cancer growth.  A recent study shows that HIF-1 (hypoxia-induced factor-1) seen in cancer cells disappeared in mice that received vitamin C. HIF-1 helps free radicals in feeding cancer cells by converting sugar to energy. Vitamin C is present cereals, kiwi fruits, beef, poultry, fish, guava, oranges, parsley, and other fruits and vegetables.<br><br>(7) Carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) are yellow, orange, and red pigments synthesized by plants. They are precursors of vitamin A which is essential for normal growth and development, immune system function and vision. Vitamin A is found in 3 main forms: retinol (vitamin A1), 3, 4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2), and 3-hydroxy-retinol (vitamin A3). It is found in liver, sweet potatoes, carrots, milk, egg yolks, and mozzarella cheese.<br><br>(8) Carotenoids increase the expression of gene encoding for a protein called connexin which in turn facilitate communication between neighboring cells to maintain cell differentiation. If this communication is lost, cell differentiation is disrupted leading to cancer cell formation. Carotenoids also reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Carotenoids are absorbed together with fats in the diet.<br><br>(9) Beta-carotene is active during low oxygen pressures. Conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A is decreased when body stores of vitamin A are high. However, a study showed that intake of beta-carotene increased lung cancer rates in male smokers. The cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine and colestipol can reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and these carotenoids. Omeprazole and lansoprazole, medicines used to increase gastric pH in cases of hyperacidity also decrease the absorption of beta-carotenes. Beta-carotene is found in foods that are orange in color, including sweet potatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, squash, apricots and mangoes.<br><br>(10) Lutein neutralizes oxidants formed in the retina. They regulate the amount of blue light entering the eye therefore protecting it from light-induced oxidative damage. They are abundant in green, leafy vegetables such as collard greens, spinach and kale.<br>(11) Lycopene is associated with significant reductions in the risk of prostate cancer. Lycopene is found in tomatoes, watermelon, papaya, and pink grapefruits.<br><br>(12) Selenium is a mineral, not an antioxidant nutrient. However, it is a component of antioxidant enzymes. Plant foods like rice and wheat are the major dietary sources of selenium. The amount of selenium in soil, which varies across different regions, determines the amount of selenium in the foods grown in that soil. Animals that eat grains or plants grown in selenium-rich soil have higher levels of selenium in their muscle. It can also be found in meats, bread and Brazilian nuts.<br><br>(13) Coffee is also an antioxidant. Its caffeine content increases the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine which can reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease. Chlorogenic acid is the prominent polyphenol in coffee which is a cancer fighting agent. Caffeic acid (caffeine) works together with chlorogenic acid to protect cerebral neurons to promote cell differentiation and normalize colon function. This combination is effective in halting breast cancer cells, liver cirrhosis, dementia, colon cancer, gallstones, and Alzheimer's disease. It also has trigonelline which has anti-adhesive and antibacterial properties preventing tooth decay.<br><br>(14) Both green tea and black tea contain antioxidants. They contain a catechin named epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which helps the arteries relax and expand to prevent cardiovascular disorders. Green tea (from Camellia sinensis) reduces the levels of amyloid alpha in patients with diabetes making them less prone to cardiovascular diseases. Green tea also reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease and improves oral health as well.<br><br>(15) Recent studies in the U.S. suggest that certain products interfere with antioxidant absorption such as dairy products which contain a milk protein called casein which has great affinity for polyphenols present in antioxidants therefore destroying their health benefits.<br>", "AIDS<br><br>(1) AIDS was first recognized in 1981 when there was an unexplained occurrence of Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in 5 previously healthy individuals. In 1984, Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found to be the etiologic agent of AIDS.<br><br>(2) The hallmark of HIV disease is a profound immunodeficiency resulting primarily from a progressive deficiency of the subset of T lymphocytes. This subset of T cells contains CD4 molecule in its surface which serves as a primary receptor for HIV. CD4 molecule is a protein on the T-lymphocytes responsible for helper function in the immune system. The co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are needed for efficient fusion and entry of HIV. When the number of CD4+ T cells declines below a certain level, the patient is at high risk of developing a variety of opportunistic diseases.<br><br>(3) HIV is an RNA virus whose hallmark is the reverse transcriptase enzyme that causes reverse transcription of genomic RNA to DNA. HIV binds with the CD4 molecule. Once the virus is present, it catalyzes the transcription of RNA to DNA. DNA translocates to the nucleus and is integrated to the host cell chromosome through the help of the integrase enzyme. Once the cell is activated, the DNA formed will bud off from the cell to infect other cells.<br><br>(4) HIV infection is unique among human viral infections. Unlike other viruses, once HIV infection has been established, the virus succeeds in escaping the immune responses and is virtually never eliminated completely from the body. HIV infection very rarely kills the host during primary infection. Rather, a chronic infection develops that persists with varying degrees of virus replication in the untreated patient for a median of ~10 years before the patient becomes clinically ill. It is this establishment of a chronic, persistent infection that is the hallmark of HIV disease.<br><br>(5) Initially, CD4+ T cells increase with the start of HIV infection. But as HIV progresses, the level of CD4+ T cells in the blood decrease progressively. Most patients are entirely asymptomatic while this progressive decline is taking place. In untreated patients or in patients in whom therapy has not adequately controlled virus replication after a variable period, the CD4+ T cell count falls below a critical level of <200/uL and the patient becomes highly susceptible to opportunistic disease. The case definition of AIDS includes all HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ T cell counts below this level. It is not uncommon for CD4+ T cell counts to drop as low as 10/uL or even to zero, yet such patients may survive for months or even years.<br><br>(6) HIV is transmitted by both homosexual and heterosexual contact; by blood and blood products; and by infected mothers to infants either during pregnancy or via breast milk.<br><br>(7) There are a number of different tests that can be used to diagnose HIV infection. The most commonly used tests are called HIV antibody tests. Antibodies are the bodyâ€™s reaction to HIV. Standard antibody HIV testing can have two stages. The most commonly used initial screening test is either an enzyme immune assay (EIA) or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the EIA/ELISA test is negative, no additional testing is done. If the EIA/ELISA screening test is positive, that result must be confirmed with a more specific test called Western Blot. Rapid HIV testing using oral fluids or blood specimens are EIA/ELISA screening tests that provide results in 20 minutes. This kind of test has been shown to be highly accurate (99.5%) and comparable to the blood tests that are performed in a laboratory.<br><br>(8) There are three clinical categories of HIV infection. Category A consists of documented HIV infection and either any of these 3: asymptomatic HIV infection; persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes); or acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection.<br><br>(9) Category B consists of symptomatic conditions in an HIV-infected individuals not listed in category C and that meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) the conditions are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or (2) the conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection.<br><br>(10) Category C consists of opportunistic disease conditions listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition such as candidiasis, invasive cervical cancer, coccidioiodomycosis, cytomegalovirus disease, HIV-related encephalopathy, herpes simplex, Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, lymphoma, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, recurrent pneumonia, toxoplasmosis of the brain, recurrent salmonella septicemia and wasting syndrome due to HIV.<br><br>(11) Regardless of the portal of entry of HIV, lymphoid tissues are the major anatomic sites for the establishment and propagation of HIV infection. HIV can infect almost all organs of the body. The presence of very opportunistic diseases in the body is clinical clue to the diagnosis of AIDS.  Another debilitating complication of AIDS is HIV-related encephalopathy or the HIV-associated dementia or AIDS dementia complex. This happens once HIV has reached the brain. It is generally a late complication of HIV infection that progresses slowly over months though it can be seen even in patients whose CD4 counts are greater than 350/uL. A major feature of this entity is the development of dementia, defined as a decline in cognitive ability from a previous level. It may present as impaired ability to concentrate, increased forgetfulness, difficulty reading, or increased difficulty performing complex tasks. It consists of five clinical stages.<br><br>(12) Stage 0 (normal) consists of normal mental and motor function. Stage 0.5 (equivocal/subclinical) consists of absent, minimal, or equivocal symptoms without impairment of work or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Mild signs may be present such as snout response, slowed ocular or extremity movements. Walking and strength are normal. Stage 1 (mild), patients are able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or activities of daily living but with unequivocal evidence of functional, intellectual, or motor impairment. Patients in this stage can walk without assistance. Stage 2 (moderate) consists of ability to perform basic activities of self-care but cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life. Walking is possible but may require a single prop. Stage 3 (severe) has major intellectual incapacity (cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, considerable slowing of all output) or motor disability (cannot walk unassisted, usually with slowing and clumsiness of arms as well). Stage 4 (end-stage) is nearly vegetative. Intellectual and social comprehension and output are at a rudimentary level. Patient is nearly or absolutely mute. Patient can be paralyzed with urinary and fecal incontinence.<br><br>(13) Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is initiated and continued whenever necessary. Each drug acts on the different stages of HIV infection. Among these drugs, Zidovudine is the only drug that can be used alone. All the other drugs available should be used in combination with other drugs. Zidovudine is the only drug for prevention of maternal to fetal HIV transmission.<br><br>(14) There are also adverse drug reactions for each medication that should be monitored while taking the drug. Didanosine may cause pancreatitis (swelling of pancreas) and abnormalities in the liver function tests. Zalcitabine also causes pancreatitis, liver enlargement and oral ulcers. Stavudine also causes pancreatitis, liver damage and neuromuscular weakness. Abacavir may cause fever and rash while Tenofovir can damage the kidneys. Delavirdine also causes skin rash and liver damage. Saquinavir, Indinavir and Ritonavir cause abdominal pain, increased blood sugar and fat redistribution. Indinavir may also cause kidney stones. Nelfinavir side effects present as diarrhea seen as loose stools. Amprenavir also causes damage to the liver and tingling sensations/numbness around the lips. Enfuvirtide on the other hand, may increase the rate of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients.<br>", "Hemeproteins<br><br>(1) Hemeproteins are a group of specialized proteins that contain heme as a tightly bound prosthetic group. A prosthetic group is a tightly bound coenzyme that does not dissociate from the enzyme. The role of the heme group is dictated by the environment created by the three-dimensional structure of the protein. In hemoglobin and myoglobin, the two most abundant hemeproteins in humans, the heme group serves to reversibly bind oxygen.<br><br>(2) Hemoglobin is found exclusively in red blood cells, where its main function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the capillaries of the tissues. Hemoglobin A, the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four polypeptide chains - two alpha chains and two beta chains --- held together by noncovalent interactions. The oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin are regulated by interaction with allosteric effectors.<br><br>(3) Hemoglobin has a quaternary structure. The hemoglobin tetramer has two identical dimers, (&alpha;&beta;)1 and (&alpha;&beta;)2. The two polypeptide chains within each dimer are held tightly together, primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Ionic and hydrogen bonds also occur between the members of the dimer. In contrast, the two dimers are able to move with respect to each other, being held together primarily by polar bonds. The weaker interactions between these mobile dimers result in the two dimers occupying different relative positions in deoxyhemoglobin as compared with oxyhemoglobin.<br><br>(4) The deoxy form of hemoglobin is called the 'T', or taut (tense) form. In the T form, the two &alpha;&beta; dimers interact through a network of ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that constrain the movement of the polypeptide chains. The T form is the low oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. This results in deoxyhemoglobin.<br><br>(5) The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin causes the rupture of some of the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds between the &alpha;&beta; dimers. This leads to a structure called the 'R', or relaxed form, in which the polypeptide chains have more freedom of movement. The R form is the high oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. This results in oxyhemoglobin.<br><br>(6) Hemoglobin can bind four oxygen molecules -one at each of its four heme groups. The degree of saturation of these oxygen-binding sites on all hemoglobin molecules can vary between zero (all sites are empty) and 100 percent (all sites are full).<br><br>(7) Hemoglobin can be plotted in a graph using hemoglobinâ€™s percent saturation with oxygen at the y-axis plotted against partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) at x-axis. This is the oxygen-dissociation curve. The partial pressure of oxygen needed to achieve half-saturation of the binding sites (P<sub>50</sub>) is approximately 26 mmHg for hemoglobin. The higher the oxygen affinity, the more tightly oxygen binds, the lower the P<sub>50</sub>.<br><br>(8) The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin is sigmoidal in shape indicating that the subunits cooperate in binding oxygen. Cooperative binding of oxygen by the four subunits of hemoglobin means that the binding of an oxygen molecule at one heme group increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining heme groups in the same hemoglobin molecule. This effect is referred to as heme-heme interaction. Although it is more difficult for the first oxygen molecule to bind to hemoglobin, the subsequent binding of oxygen occurs with high affinity. The oxygen-dissociation curve is steepest at the oxygen concentrations that occur in the tissues. This permits oxygen delivery to respond to small changes in pO<sub>2</sub>.<br><br>(9) The ability of hemoglobin to reversibly bind to oxygen is affected by the pO<sub>2</sub>, the pH of the environment, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and the availability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. These are collectively called allosteric effectors, because their interaction at one site on the hemoglobin molecule affects the binding of oxygen to heme groups at other locations on the molecule.<br><br>(10) The sigmoidal oxygen-binding curve reflects specific structural changes that are initiated at one heme group and transmitted to other heme groups in the hemoglobin tetramer. The net effect is that the affinity of hemoglobin for the last oxygen bound is approximately 300 times greater than its affinity for the first oxygen bound.<br><br>(11) The cooperative binding of oxygen allows hemoglobin to deliver more oxygen to the tissues in response to relatively small changes in the arterial pressure of oxygen. For example, in the lungs, the concentration of oxygen is high and hemoglobin becomes virtually saturated (or 'loaded') with oxygen. In contrast, in the peripheral tissues, oxyhemoglobin releases (or 'unloads') much of its oxygen for use in the oxidative metabolism of the tissues.<br><br>(12) The release of oxygen from hemoglobin is enhanced when the pH is lowered or when the hemoglobin is in the presence of an increased partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. At lower pH, a greater pO<sub>2</sub> is required to achieve any given oxygen saturation. Both result in decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and, therefore, a shift to the right in the oxygen dissociation curve. The change in oxygen binding is called the Bohr Effect. Conversely, raising the pH or lowering the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> results in greater affinity for oxygen, and a shift to the left in the oxygen-dissociation curve.<br><br>(13) The Bohr Effect reflects the fact that the deoxy form of hemoglobin has a greater affinity for protons than does oxyhemoglobin. An increase in the concentration of protons (resulting in a decrease in pH, lower pO<sub>2</sub>) causes these groups to become protonated (charged) and able to form ionic bonds (also called salt bridges). These bonds preferentially stabilize the deoxy form of hemoglobin, producing a decrease in oxygen affinity.<br><br>(14) Human hemoglobin A (HbA) is just one member of hemoglobins. Each of these oxygen-carrying proteins is a tetramer, composed of 2 &alpha;-globin-like polypeptides and 2 &beta;-globin-like polypeptides. Certain hemoglobins, such as HbF, are normally synthesized only during fetal development, whereas others, such as HbA<sub>2</sub>, are synthesized in the adult, although at low levels compared with HbA.  HbA can also become modified by the covalent addition of a hexose. For example, addition of glucose forms the glycosylated hemoglobin derivative, HbA1c, which is used in blood sugar monitoring.<br><br>(15) Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) also contains two gamma chains. In the first few weeks after conception, embryonic hemoglobin (Hb Gower 1), composed of 2 zeta chains and 2 epsilon chains, is synthesized by the embryonic yolk sac. Within a few weeks, the fetal liver begins to synthesize HbF in the developing bone marrow. HbF is the major hemoglobin found in the fetus and newborn, accounting for about sixty percent of the total hemoglobin in the red blood cells during the last months of fetal life. HbA synthesis starts in the bone marrow at about eighth month of pregnancy and gradually replaces HbF.<br><br>(16) HbA<sub>2</sub> is a minor component of normal adult hemoglobin, first appearing about twelve weeks after birth and, ultimately, constituting about two percent of the total hemoglobin. It is composed of two &alpha;-globin chains and two delta-globin chains.<br><br>(17) Under physiologic conditions, HbA is slowly and non-enzymatically glycosylated, the extent of glycosylation being dependent on the plasma concentration of a particular hexose. The most abundant form of glycosylated hemoglobin is HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Increased amounts of HbA<sub>1c</sub> are found in red blood cells of patients with diabetes mellitus, because their HbA has contact with higher glucose concentrations during the 120 day lifetime of red blood cells.<br>");
INSERT INTO datedge_test (id, text1, text2, text3) VALUES (2, "Fibrous Proteins<br><br>(1) Proteins may be classified on the basis of their solubility, shape, biologic function, or three-dimensional structure. Proteins may also be classified based on their overall shape --- either globular or fibrous. Globular proteins are compactly folded, coiled polypeptide chains with axial ratios (ratios of length to breadth) of less than 10 and generally not greater than 3-4. In contrast, fibrous proteins have axial ratios greater than 10.<br><br>(2) Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They have long parallel polypeptide chains with cross linkages at intervals forming long fibers or sheets. They are usually insoluble having many structural roles. Globular proteins have complex tertiary and sometimes quaternary structures which are folded into spherical (globular) shapes. They are usually soluble as hydrophobic side chains in the center of structure. They have roles in metabolic reactions.<br><br>(3) Collagen and elastin are the most common fibrous proteins that serve structural functions in the body. For example, collagen and elastin are found as components of skin, connective tissue, blood vessel walls, sclera and cornea of the eye. Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which are obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary, structural elements. This is in contrast to globular proteins, whose shapes are the result of complex interactions between secondary, tertiary, and, sometimes, quaternary structural elements.<br><br>(4) Collagen is the most abundant protein in humans. A typical collagen molecule is a long, rigid structure in which three polypeptides (referred to as alpha-chains) are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix. Although these molecules are found throughout the body, their types and organization are dictated by the structural role collagen plays in a particular organ. In some tissues, collagen may be dispersed as a gel that gives support to the structure, as in the extracellular matrix or the vitreous humor of the eye. In other tissues, collagen may be bundled in tight, parallel fibers that provide great strength, as in tendons. In the cornea of the eye, collagen is stacked so as to transmit light with minimum scattering. Collagen of bone occurs as fibers arranged at an angle to each other so as to resist mechanical shear from any direction.<br>(5) The collagen superfamily of proteins includes more than twenty collagen types. The three polypeptide alpha-chains are held together by hydrogen bonds between the chains. These alpha-chains are combined to form the various types of collagen found in the tissues. The collagens can be organized into three groups, based on their location and functions in the body. They can be fibril-forming, network-forming or fibril-associated collagens.<br><br>(6) Types I, II and III are the fibril-forming or fibrillar collagens. They have a rope-like structure. In the electron microscope, these linear polymers of fibrils have characteristic banding patterns, reflecting the regular staggered packing of the individual collagen molecules in the fibril. Type I collagen fibers are found in supporting elements of high tensile strength whereas fibrils formed from type II collagen molecules are restricted to cartilaginous structures. Type III collagen are prevalent in more distensible tissues, such as blood vessels. Type I is found in skin, bone, tendon, blood vessels, and cornea; type II is found in cartilages, intervertebral disks, and vitreous body; while type III in blood vessels, and fetal skin.<br><br>(7) Types IV and VII form a three-dimensional mesh, rather than distinct fibrils and are thus called network-forming collagens. Type IV collagens assemble into a sheet or meshwork that constitutes a major part of basement membranes. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that provide mechanical support for adjacent cells, and function as a semipermeable filtration barrier for macromolecules in organs such as the kidney and lungs. Type IV is found in basement membranes, type VII is found beneath stratified squamous epithelia.<br><br>(8) Types IX and XII are fibril-associated collagens which bind to the surface of collagen fibrils, linking these fibrils to one another and to other components in the extracellular matrix. Type IX is in cartilages and type XII in tendons, ligaments, and some other tissues.<br><br>(9) Like other connective tissues, collagen also contains amino acids which are building blocks of proteins. Collagen is rich in amino acids proline and glycine, both of which are important in the formation of the triple-stranded helix. Proline facilitates the formation of the helical conformation of each alpha-chain because its ring structure causes kinks in the peptide chain. Glycine, the smallest amino acid, is found in every 3rd position of the polypeptide chain. It fits into the restricted spaces where the 3 chains of the helix come together. The glycine residues are part of a repeating sequence, Gly-X-Y-, where X is frequently proline and Y is often hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine. Hydroxyproline is important in stabilizing the triple-helical structure because it maximizes interchain hydrogen bond formation.<br><br>(10) Defects in any steps of collagen synthesis can result in a genetic disease involving an inability of collagen to form fibers properly and less tensile strength. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can result from an inheritable deficiency of collagen-processing enzymes or from mutations in the protein sequences of collagen types I, III or V. The most clinically important mutations are found in the gene for type III collagen. Collagen containing mutant chains is not secreted, and is either degraded or accumulated to high levels in intracellular compartments. Because collagen type III is an important component of arteries, potentially lethal blood vessel problems occur. Defects in type I fibrils result in stretchy skin and loose joints.<br><br>(11) Brittle bone syndrome or Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is heterogenous group of inherited disorders characterized by bones that easily bend and fracture. Retarded wound healing and a rotated and twisted spine leading to a humped-back appearance are common features of the disease. Type I OI is called osteogenesis imperfecta tarda which presents in early infancy with fractures secondary to minor trauma, and may be suspected if prenatal ultrasound detects bowing or fractures of long bones. Type II OI, osteogenesis imperfecta congenital, is more severe, and may die in utero or in the neonatal period due to lung problems. Severe OI have mutations in the gene for either pro1- or pro2-alpha-chains of type I collagen. The most common mutation occurs in glycine substitution as every 3rd amino acid thus preventing folding of the protein into a triple-helical structure.<br><br>(12) In contrast to collagen, which forms fibers that are tough and have high tensile strength, elastin is a connective tissue protein with rubber-like properties which can be found in lungs, walls of large arteries and elastic ligaments. They can be stretched to several times their normal length, but recoil to their original shape when the stretching force is relaxed.<br><br>(13) Elastin is an insoluble protein polymer synthesized from a precursor, tropoelastin, which is secreted by the cell into the extracellular space. There it interacts with a specific glycoprotein microfibril, such as fibrillin, which functions as a scaffold onto which tropoelastin is deposited. Mutations in the fibrillin gene are responsible for Marfan's syndrome.<br><br>(14) Blood and other body fluids contain alpha1-antitrypsin (&#945;1-AT) that inhibits a number of enzymes that hydrolyze and destroy proteins. &#945;1-AT has the important physiologic role of inhibiting elastase - a powerful protease that degrades elastin of the walls of the lungs (alveolar walls), as well as other structural proteins in a variety of tissues. Most of the &#945;1-AT found in plasma is synthesized and secreted by the liver.<br><br>(15) In the normal lung, the elastin promotes the expansion and instant recoil of the alveolar walls. Elastase degrades the elastin in the alveolar walls. &#945;1-AT opposes the action of elastase thus keeping the alveolar walls expanded to promote air exchange. If there is a deficiency of &#945;1-AT (such in &#945;1-AT gene mutation), there will be a destruction of the connective tissue of alveolar walls resulting to collapse of alveolar walls called emphysema. Smoking also promotes degradation of &#945;1-AT.<br>", "Glucose<br><br>(1) Glucose is a six-carbon sugar used by the body as main source of energy. When we eat carbohydrates, it is broken down into glucose and carried throughout the blood stream (hence the term blood sugar) to be distributed to the different parts of the body. If energy is not needed such as during rest, glucose is transformed to its storage forms, such as glycogen and reserved for future use.<br><br>(2) Glucose level is properly controlled by a balance of hormones from the pancreas. The pancreas contains the islets of Langerhans. Each islet contains five different cells, two of which are: alpha cells that secrete glucagon which raises glucose and beta cells that secrete insulin which lowers glucose. Proper balance between the action of these two hormones (insulin and glucagon) is necessary to maintain normal glucose levels. Hyperglycemia happens once glucose exceeds the normal level required leading to diabetes mellitus.<br><br>(3) Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by an elevation of fasting blood glucose caused by a relative or absolute deficiency in insulin. DM can be separated into two groups: type 1 (formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 (formerly called non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).<br><br>(4) Type 1 DM is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin caused by an autoimmune attack on beta cells. The body does not recognize the beta cells as its own and destroys it. For several years, this autoimmune attack leads to gradual depletion of beta cells. However, symptoms are abrupt and only appear when eighty to ninety percent of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point, the pancreas fails to respond adequately to ingestion of glucose, and insulin therapy is required to restore glucose control. This destruction of beta cells happens when there is both a stimulus from the environment (such as a viral infection) and a genetic determinant (mutation) that allows the beta cells to be recognized as 'non-self.'<br><br>(5) The onset of type 1 DM is typically during childhood or puberty. There is abrupt appearance of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and polyphagia (excessive hunger), often triggered by stress or an illness. These symptoms are usually accompanied by fatigue, weight loss, and weakness. The diagnosis of type 1 DM is confirmed by a fasting blood sugar (FBS) greater than 126 mg/dL, commonly accompanied by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).<br><br>(6) Ketoacidosis is the state wherein the body accumulates ketone bodies or ketones and the blood pH falls below normal causing acidosis which can lead to coma. Normally, our body relies on glucose as main energy source. If glucose is adequate, insulin enhances storage of fatty acids in adipose tissue for future energy use. Insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase to transform fatty acids to its storage form. If glucose is low or absent, fatty acids are broken down to form ketones for energy use. In type 1 DM, insulin is absent, thus, there is no stimulus for lipoprotein lipase to store fatty acids. The net effect is breaking down of fatty acids forming ketones. If left unopposed, ketone accumulation decreases blood pH leading to ketoacidosis which can be fatal.<br><br>(7) In the past, the glucose tolerance test was used to diagnose DM. After an eight hour fasting, FBS is taken. The patient is then given 75 grams of glucose orally. Blood glucose concentrations will be determined at thirty minute intervals for the next three hours. Normally, FBS is less than 100 mg/dL, and rises less than 140 mg/dL after a glucose load. In DM, FBS is initially high (greater than 126 mg/dL), and rises to concentrations greater than 200 mg/dL after glucose load.<br><br>(8) However, the glucose tolerance test gives many false-positive results because the test itself can be stress-inducing, causing release of the hormone epinephrine. This hormone decreases the release of insulin from the beta cells, thus, impairs the response to a glucose load.  At present, glucose tolerance test is used only when diagnosis is uncertain or to test for pregnancy-induced DM. For the general population, FBS is more commonly used as diagnostic tool.<br><br>(9) Type 2 DM, the more common type, develops gradually without obvious symptoms. It is often detected by routine screening tests. Polyuria and polydipsia may be present for several weeks prior to diagnosis. Polyphagia may be present, but is less common. Type 2 DM patients have a combination of insulin resistance and dysfunctional beta cells but do not require insulin to sustain life. The metabolic alterations observed in type 2 DM are milder than type 1. Diagnosis is based on the presence of hyperglycemia (FBS greater than 126 mg/dL). It does not involve viruses or autoimmune antibodies. Type 2 DM is more likely to be hereditary than type 1.<br><br>(10) Insulin resistance is the decreased ability of target tissues, such as liver, adipose tissue and muscles to respond properly to normal circulating concentrations of insulin. Insulin resistance may be characterized by uncontrolled liver (hepatic) glucose production, and decreased glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue. There may be normal or low insulin present but the body does not react to its presence. This is in contrast to type 1 DM where insulin is not just low but absent due to destruction of beta cells.<br><br>(11) Obesity is the most common cause of insulin resistance. In the absence of a defect in beta cell function, non-diabetic, obese individuals can compensate for insulin resistance with elevated levels of insulin. Insulin secretion is 2-3 times higher in obese people than it is in lean ones. This higher insulin concentration compensates for the diminished effect of the hormone (as a result of insulin resistance), and restores blood glucose back to normal levels. However, if insulin resistance persists due to continuous obesity, insulin slowly decreases.<br><br>(12) Insulin resistance alone will not lead to type 2 DM. Rather, type 2 DM develops in insulin-resistant individuals who also show impaired beta cell function. Insulin resistance and subsequent development of type 2 DM is commonly observed in the elderly, and in individuals who are obese, physically inactive, or in pregnant women. These patients are unable to sufficiently compensate for insulin resistance with increased insulin release.<br><br>(13) Insulin resistance increases with weight gain, and diminishes with weight loss. Fat accumulation affects insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage organ for fats, but also a secretory organ. Adipose tissues produce regulatory substances: leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, which all contribute to the development of insulin resistance.<br><br>(14) In type 2 DM, beta cells are dysfunctional because it fails to secrete enough insulin to correct the prevailing hyperglycemia. The natural progression of type 2 DM results in a declining ability to control hyperglycemia with endogenous secretion of insulin. Deterioration of beta cell function may be accelerated by the toxic effects of sustained hyperglycemia and elevated fatty acids. Ketoacidosis is usually minimal or absent in type 2 DM because the presence of insulin - even in the presence of insulin resistance - diminishes fatty acid breakdown.<br><br>(15) Hyperglycemia and ketones are the hallmarks of untreated type 1 DM. DKA is treated by replacing fluid and electrolytes, followed by administration of low-dose insulin to gradually correct hyperglycemia without precipitating hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Since insulin is virtually absent in type 1, patients rely on exogenous insulin injected subcutaneously to control the hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.<br><br>(16) In type 2 DM, the goal is to maintain blood glucose within normal and prevent long-term complications. Weight reduction, exercise, diet modification and oral medications (if necessary) correct the hyperglycemia. Insulin is used in cases of poorly controlled hyperglycemia despite oral medications.<br><br>(17) Long-term complications of DM can be macrovascular or microvascular. Macrovascular complications affect the large blood vessels of the body causing stroke and heart diseases. The microvascular complications affect the small blood vessels of the body mainly in the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy) and nerves (neuropathy).<br>", "Immune System<br><br>(1) The human immune system has an innate immune system and an adaptive immune system. The innate immune system was inherited from invertebrates and uses germ line-encoded proteins to recognize pathogens. Important components for the recognition of microbes by the innate immune system are recognition by germ line-encoded host molecules, recognition of key microbe virulence factors but not recognition of self molecules, and non-recognition of benign foreign molecules or microbes.<br><br>(2) Adaptive immunity is found only in vertebrates and is based on the generation of antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes bringing both specificity and immune memory to vertebrate host defenses. It is characterized by antigen-specific responses to a foreign antigen or pathogen. A key feature of adaptive immunity is that following the initial contact with antigen (immunologic priming), subsequent antigen exposure leads to more rapid and vigorous immune responses (immunologic memory). The adaptive immune system consists of dual limbs of cellular and humoral immunity. The principal effectors of cellular immunity are T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes for humoral immunity.<br><br>(3) The normal human body harbors a complex microbial ecosystem. Generally, these commensal organisms (referred to as the indigenous flora) are considered to be non-pathogenic or non-infectious. Commensal organisms are not truly parasitic, which live in, with, or on another organism, partaking usually the same food. Both species may be benefited by the association. Infection and disease may result, however, when the body is challenged by a known pathogen or when the bodyâ€™s defense system is disturbed, allowing uncontrolled growth or invasion by the indigenous flora.<br><br>(4) Microorganisms can interact with humans in several ways. Most indigenous organisms seldom cause disease. Many of the organisms normally found on the skin and mucous membranes are widespread but may cause disease in unusual settings such as when host defenses are significantly impaired or when artificial material such as a catheter or a prosthetic joint is present. Examples of these organisms are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species.<br><br>(5) Some indigenous organisms may cause disease in other body sites. Many bacteria that normally exist in one body site may cause morbidity elsewhere. For example, alpha-hemolytic (viridians) streptococcus organisms are commensals in the oral mucosa but can cause endocarditis if they are inoculated into the blood and settle on a previously damaged heart valve. In addition, enteric aerobes and anaerobes, which normally exist in high density in the intestines, can cause peritonitis and abscess formation if the intestine is perforated and these bacteria spill into the abdominal cavity.<br><br>(6) Transient organisms may cause disease. The bodyâ€™s normal flora may allow the temporary growth of certain microbes, which disappear spontaneously but may cause disease while present. For example, patients with invasive meningococcemia first have tonsillar bacteria called Neisseria meningitides, but only a tiny fraction of patients ever develop systemic disease.<br><br>(7) Pathogenic organisms usually cause disease. Most viruses, as well as Chlamydia and Rickettsia, rarely are isolated from humans except during or following an acute illness. Some pathogenic bacteria include Brucella and Salmonella species, Neisseria gonorrhea, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br><br>(8) The human body has many ways of defending itself from potentially pathogenic microorganisms through anatomic barriers, cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Anatomic barriers are integral in preventing infection. These include physical barriers such as intact skin and mucous membranes, as well as functional barriers such as the muscular protection of the glottis and urinary bladder. Herpetic whitlow occurs when broken skin comes into contact with herpes simplex virus. Similarly, nonsterile intravenous injection of drugs may allow skin flora to enter the bloodstream and lead to the development of endocarditis. Mechanical devices such as indwelling bladder catheters and endotracheal tubes allow the bacterial colonization of normally sterile sites; this colonization may lead to infection.<br><br>(9) Cellular immunity consists of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. Neutrophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are phagocytic cells that are important for ingesting and killing microorganisms that breach normal body defenses. The process in which phagocytes engulf and digest microorganisms is called phagocytosis. When neutrophils are reduced substantially in number (a condition termed neutropenia), pyogenic bacteria and fungi that are commensals of the skin or gut such as Escherichia coli and Candida albicans can cause serious infections.<br><br>(10) Functional abnormalities of neutrophils may result in syndromes of varying type and severity. For example, patients with chronic granulomatous disease, caused by deficiency of NADPH oxidase, are prone to infections by catalase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, many gram-negative bacteria and fungi. These infections start early in life and tend to be severe and recurrent. Conversely, patients with lazy leukocyte syndrome tend to have mild, easily treatable infections associated with the upper respiratory tract.<br><br>(11) Monocytes and their tissue forms- macrophages are also important for the ingestion of pathogenic microbes as well as for the production of modulators of the immune system like cytokines, and interleukins. However, some microorganisms are resistant to macrophage killing. After phagocytosis, these bacteria may be protected from those antibodies that do not penetrate macrophages. Examples of these bacteria are Salmonella, Legionella, and Mycobacterium species.<br><br>(12) Lymphocytes are the third component of the cellular immune system. T lymphocytes, or T cells, have many roles in modulating the activities of other T cells, monocytes and B lymphocytes, or B cells. Antigen-specific T cells are responsible for delayed hypersensitivity and for controlling infections caused by a variety of agents, including species of Mycobacterium, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus.<br><br>(13) T cells are broadly divided into helper T cells (Th) cells and suppressor (Ts) cells based on their effect on the immune system in terms of augmenting or diminishing the immune response. Th cells like CD4 cells tend to up-regulate the immune response, and Ts cells like CD8 cells tend to down-regulate the immune response. T cells also play a pivotal role in the manifestations of autoimmune disease.<br><br>(14) Humoral immunity consists of antibody-mediated immunity and complement system. Antibody-mediated immunity involves the production of antibody by activated B cells which are stimulated by exposure to the proper antigen and to Th cells to differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells essentially are factories for the production of immunoglobulins, which they excrete into their environment. Immunoglobulins facilitate phagocytosis and activate complement, thus resulting in a more rapid clearance of the antigen. The absence or profound deficiency of immunoglobulins leads to recurrent infections caused primarily by encapsulated bacteria like Hemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia.<br><br>(15) The complement system, a cascading series of glycoproteins, tags foreign material to promote phagocytosis or directly damages or destroys infective organisms. Severe complement deficiencies may predispose individuals to infections. For example, the reduced production of one or more of the late complement components predisposes to overwhelming neisserial infections.<br><br>(16) Microbial virulence factors are important in determining the likelihood of infection. To infect a host, microorganisms or their products must adhere to host tissue. Some microbes invade host cells or breach barriers to reach susceptible body sites and, along the way, avoid or overcome host defenses. In some situations like chickenpox or measles, microbes can easily infect otherwise healthy individuals who have normal host defenses but no prior exposure to the microbe.<br><br>(17) Some microbes cause disease at the contact site with the host. An example is Giardia intestinalis, which is confined to the lumen of the small bowel and causes abdominal cramping and diarrhea.<br><br>(18) Some microbes have a special ability to produce a toxin or virulence factor to cause disease. For example, a toxin elaborated by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for toxic shock syndrome.<br><br>(19) In some situations, microbes work in groups to cause disease when an individual organism lacks an essential virulence or survival quality to act alone. An example is delta hepatitis virus, which can occur only in the presence of ongoing hepatitis B infection.");
INSERT INTO datedge_test (id, text1, text2, text3) VALUES (3, "Cloning<br><br>(1) A clone is a large population of identical molecules, bacteria, or cells that arise from a common ancestor. Cloning allows for the production of a large number of identical DNA. Cloning involves complicated steps in the DNA.<br><br>(2) In the laboratory the broken strands of DNA can be covalently joined together by treating them with DNA ligase. In this way, foreign DNA can be linked to the DNA of plasmids or bacteriophages (bacterial viruses). The bacteriophages or plasmids that have foreign DNA built into them in this manner are called vectors. Usually bacteriophages insert DNA very efficiently into their host bacteria. A single bacteriophage DNA can be replicated approximately 100-fold or more per cell depending on the type of phage and its host.<br><br>(3) A vector is a molecule of DNA to which the fragment of DNA to be cloned is joined. Essential properties of a vector molecule include: it must be capable of autonomous replication within a host cell, it must contain at least one specific nucleotide sequence recognized by a restriction endonuclease and it must carry at least one gene that confers the ability to select for the vector, such as an antibiotic resistance gene. Commonly used vectors include plasmids and bacterial and animal viruses.<br><br>(4) Prokaryotic organisms contain single, large, circular chromosomes. Most species of bacteria also normally contain small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids ranging in size from 2-100 kb. They also can be amplified to approximately 20 copies per cell. Plasmids can also be introduced into bacterial cells, although less efficiently than phage vectors. Some plasmids can be used to introduce recombinant DNA into yeast cells. One usually tries to adjust experimental conditions so that only one plasmid or phage is introduced into a single cell. When that cell replicates on a plate of nutrient agar, it will produce millions of cells until a colony becomes visible to the naked eye. If cells are sufficiently diluted before they are spread onto the plate, each colony will consist of a clone derived from a single ancestral cell. If each cell originally contained only one copy of the phage or plasmid vector, each colony will contain recombinant DNA that is homogeneous. That is, each colony will contain cloned DNA.<br><br>(5) Plasmids found in nature often carry genes that code for proteins that make their hosts resistant to antibiotics. These genes are used to select bacterial colonies that contain recombinant plasmids. Plasmids usually are able to carry much less foreign DNA than a bacteriophage lambda. Thus plasmid vectors mainly are used to obtain pieces of DNA (up to 3 kb in size) suitable for sequencing, to subclone larger DNAs carried by phage vectors, or to clone single expressible genes derived from complementary DNAs (cDNAs).<br><br>(6) Vectors of bacteriophage lambda can accommodate up to 23 kb of foreign DNA. The amount of DNA that can be inserted depends on the amount of nonessential lambda genes that can be replaced and the total amount of DNA that can be packaged into a particle able to be covered with phage coat proteins. Some eukaryotic genomic genes have such long intervening sequences that their DNA may not fit into one phage head. For cloning these large genes, cosmid vectors are often used.<br><br>(7) Cosmids contain only a small part of lambda DNA, the two cohesive ends (cos gene) that allow many DNA to be packaged into particles in vitro. As with bacteriophages, these particles are very efficient vehicles for inserting DNA into E. coli cells; however, unlike phages, they cannot make infectious particles in vivo. Cosmids can carry up to 40 kb of recombinant DNA. Once in the cell, cosmids behave more as plasmids do.<br><br>(8) A recombinant gene library is made by digesting cDNA or genomic DNA with one or more restriction enzymes, ligating the fragments to a vector, and introducing the vector into appropriate bacterial or yeast cells so that each cell will contain single recombinant DNA. It is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism. There are two kinds of DNA library: the genomic libraries and cDNA libraries. Genomic libraries ideally contain a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome. In contrast, cDNA libraries contain those DNA sequences that appear as mRNA molecules, and these differ from one cell type to another. Cloned cDNAs lack introns and the control regions of the genes, whereas these are present in genomic libraries.<br><br>(9) A genomic library is a collection of fragments of double-stranded DNA obtained by digestion of the total DNA of the organism with a restriction endonuclease and subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. The recombinant DNA molecules are replicated within host bacteria and the amplified DNA fragments represent the entire genome of the organism. Genomic DNA is much more complex than cDNA.<br><br>(10) cDNA can be used as a probe to locate the gene that coded for the original mRNA in mixtures containing many unrelated DNA fragments. If the mRNA used as a template is a mixture of many different species, the resulting cDNAs are heterogeneous. These mixtures can be cloned to form a cDNA library. cDNA is made in the laboratory from mRNAs using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Unlike eukaryotic genome DNA, cDNA does not contain intervening sequences. A complete cDNA may contain all the information needed to synthesize an mRNA for a specific protein. If the cDNA or its vector is modified so that the recombinant DNA has all the sequences necessary for RNA and protein synthesis, one can synthesize in bacterial cells the protein encoded in the recombinant cDNA. Such a vector is called an expression vector.<br><br> (11) Expression vectors can be used to obtain large quantities of protein that might be very difficult to isolate by conventional techniques. These special plasmids contain a bacterial promoter for transcription of the cDNA, and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence that allows the bacterial ribosome to initiate translation of the resulting mRNA molecule. This is possible because bacterial cells contain many copies of the recombinant gene and because RNA and protein synthesis occur very rapidly in bacteria. cDNA libraries are not easy to make because of the inherent instability of mRNA compared to DNA and because reverse transcriptase prematurely terminates when copying long mrRNAs.<br><br>(12) The human genomic DNA can be simplified using different methods. Using the pulsed-field electrophoresis, DNAs are separated using short pulses of current at alternating angles to the direction of movement of the DNA. There also protocols used to detect a particular DNA or RNA that has been resolved by electrophoresis. In Southern blotting, the gel is blotted to nitrocellulose paper and the DNA on the paper hybridized with a labelled DNA probe. If the procedure uses RNAs, it is termed Northern blotting while Western blotting refers to the detection of proteins immunologically.<br><br>(13) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique for amplifying small amounts of DNA when only small amounts of human tissue or cells are available. One needs to know the sequence of the DNA in question. Using the sequence, one chemically synthesizes two oligodeoxyribonucleotides of approximately 20-25 residues that are complementary to each of the two ends of the DNA of interest. These are annealed (heated, then cooled slowly) to the ends and serve as primers for the in vitro copying of each DNA strand using a heat-stable DNA polymerase called Taq polymerase. The chemically synthesized primers are in excess so that when the reaction mixture is heated to 63<sup>o</sup>C, the DNA strands separate and reanneal with more primer on cooling. This process of heating, cooling, and synthesis can be repeated many times, and in the process the DNA fragment of interest is greatly amplified. PCR can be used to detect carriers of hemophilia A, for prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell disease, and for fetal sex determination, etc.", "Embryogenesis<br><br>(1) The starting point for the production of a new individual by sexual reproduction is the fertilized egg, or zygote. Repeated mitotic divisions result in many cells that differentiate to form the tissues and organs of the developing individual or embryo.<br><br>(2) Soon after an egg is fertilized, the single-celled zygote becomes two cells, the two divide into four, and so on. This process of cleavage partitions the egg substance into an increasing number of smaller cells, or blastomeres, each with an equal number of chromosomes. The cleavage divisions are unusual because they are not separated by periods of cellular growth; the zygote mass is the same at the end of cleavage as at the start. The size distribution of the cells and the kind of division are a function of the amount and distribution of the yolk. Cleavage is termed holoblastic when an entire egg cell divides, as in the frog, and meroblastic when only part of the cell divides, as in the chick.<br><br>(3) As holoblastic cleavage occurs, as in amphibians, the cells become arranged in the form of a hollow ball, or blastula, within which a central cavity, the blastocoels, appears. Two major regions are evident, an upper animal hemisphere, or pole of small dark cells with little yolk, and an opposite vegetal hemisphere below, of larger, pale-colored cells rich in yolk granules. Between them is a marginal zone of medium-sized cells.<br><br>(4) As cells continue to proliferate, an inrolling or involution begins directly below the center of the gray crescent, a lightly pigmented area of the egg cortex important in guiding early stages of development. A slit forms, and the fold above it is the dorsal lip of the blastopore, derived from the crescent. The cells of the animal hemisphere move inward more rapidly than the larger, fewer yolky cells of the vegetal hemisphere. The slit extends laterally and downward and eventually forms a ring of involuting tissue, the blastopore, which moves over the yolk-laden vegetal hemisphere and increasingly encloses it. This process of overgrowth is called epiboly.<br><br>(5) Once inside the embryo, the involuting cells move away from the blastopore and form the walls of an enlarging chamber, the archenteron (or gastrocoel) which is the cavity of the primitive gut. The infolding process is called invagination. As the archenteron enlarges, the blastocoel is gradually obliterated. This is now called the gastrula. Epiboly and invagination are accomplished without change in the overall mass of the embryo, indicating that growth plays no part in the process of gastrulation. When complete, the gastrula consists of an outer layer of ectoderm from cells of the animal hemisphere, and inner layer of endoderm called entoderm from cells of the vegetal hemisphere, and between these a third layer, mesoderm. Since the latter at this stage includes the presumptive notochord, it may be called chordamesoderm.<br><br>(6) Most of the mesoderm invaginates by rolling over the lateral and ventral lips of the blastopore. However, the portion giving rise to the notochord moves inward over the dorsal lip and is preceded by the prechordal plate mesoderm of the head. These are the germ layers from which various tissues and organs will form. The ectoderm will produce the external covering of the body, the nervous system, and the sense organs; the endoderm provides the lining of the digestive tract, its glands, and associated structure; and the mesoderm gives rise to the supportive tissues, muscles, lining of the body cavity and other parts.<br><br>(7) At the end of gastrulation, when all the endoderm is inside, the original egg axis has rotated about 90 degrees. The former lower end of the axis then at the completed blastopore, marking the posterior end of the future animal. The chordamesoderm cells indicate the dorsal region; and shortly after gastrulation the paired neural folds on the surface, forward from the blastopore, provide an external indication of the dorsal surface.<br><br>(8) After gastrulation, major differentiation of the embryo begins. From the three germ layers there are outpocketings, inpocketings, thickenings, divisions and other changes that lead to the establishment of the organs and organ systems. The nervous system starts dorsally as a pair of neural folds. The ectoderm between these sinks down and the folds come together to form a neural tube, enlarged at the anterior end to become the brain. On either side, between the neural tube and ectoderm, a line of cells forms the neural crests that will produce the dorsal or sensory roots of spinal nerves to grow into the cord. Motor roots later grow out ventrally from the cord. The neural crests also contribute sympathetic ganglia, the Schwann cells of nerve fibers, pigment cells, and important cartilage elements of the brachial complex.<br><br>(9) The early brain has three primary vesicles, the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. The forebrain produces the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon, and from the hindbrain the cerebellum and medulla oblongata are derived. A rounded optic vesicle grows laterally on either side of the forebrain and stimulates the ectoderm on the side of the head region to form a thickened lens vesicle that subsequently produces the lens of the eye. Meanwhile, the outer surface of each optic vesicle becomes concave by invagination and forms the retina.<br><br>(10) The endoderm of the primitive gut becomes the inner lining of the digestive tract. Anteriorly, at the future pharynx, three outpocketings of the tract on either side meet three corresponding inpocketings from the side of the neck; these break through to form the gill slits. A single ventral outpocket, behind the pharynx, forms the liver bud that becomes the liver and bile duct. An inpocketing of ectoderm called stomodeum forms ventrally on the head region, and a similar one called proctodeum at the posterior end. In later embryonic life these break through to join the endoderm of the digestive tract, the stomodeum becoming the mouth cavity and the proctodeum becoming the anal canal, both lined by ectoderm. During larval life a ventral outpocket of the pharynx grows posteriorly and divides into two lobes. The anterior part gives rise to the larynx and trachea and the lobes to the lungs.<br><br>(11) During gastrulation, the mesoderm grows inward and penetrates between the ectoderm and endoderm. Cells in its middorsal part become arranged as a solid rod, the notochord, between the nerve tube and primitive gut, to serve as a supporting body axis. Prospective mesoderm at either side of the notochord grows down as a curved plate between the ectoderm and endoderm, and the two meet ventrally under the yolk-laden cells. The thin lower part of each plate called hypomere splits into two layers. The outer is applied to the ectoderm and becomes the parietal peritoneum, the inner surrounds the gut to make the visceral peritoneum and smooth muscle of the gut, and the space between the layers is the body cavity, or coelom. The upper most mesoderm called epimere at either side of the nerve tube and notochord forms a lengthwise series of segmental blocks or somites. Each somite differentiates into three parts: a thin outer part called dermatome becomes the dermis of the skin, a thick inner part called myotome gives rise to voluntary muscles, and nearest the notochord, a scattering of cells called sclerotome grow about the neural tube and notochord to form the vertebrae or axial skeleton. Between the ventral plates and the somites a third portion called mesomere is the forerunner of the excretory system and parts of the reproductive system.", "Emphysema<br><br>(1) The air that we breathe in passes through our nose to the trachea and then to the lungs. The lung airways - the main right and left bronchus - arise from the trachea then branch to give rise to progressively smaller airways. Progressive branching of the bronchus forms bronchioles, which are distinguished from bronchus by the lack of cartilage and submucosal glands within their walls. Further branching of bronchioles leads to the terminal bronchioles, which are less than 2 mm in diameter. The part of the lung distal or farther from the terminal bronchiole is called the acinus or the terminal respiratory unit; it is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 7 mm. An acinus contains the alveolus (alveoli - plural) which serves as the site of gas exchange. An acinus is composed of respiratory bronchioles which then proceed into the alveolar ducts, which immediately branch and empty into the alveolar sacs.<br><br>(2) Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, accompanied by destruction of their walls, and without obvious fibrosis or scarring. In contrast, the enlargement of airspaces unaccompanied by destruction is termed overinflation. Emphysema is defined in terms of the anatomic nature of lesion. There are four major types of emphysema: centriacinar, panacinar, paraseptal and irregular. Of these, only the first two cause clinically significant airflow obstruction. Centriacinar emphysema is far more common than the panacinar form.<br><br>(3) Centriacinar or centrilobular emphysema involves the central or proximal parts of the acinus, formed by the respiratory bronchioles, whereas the distal parts are spared. Thus, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus. The lesions are more common and usually more severe in the upper lobes, particularly in the apical segments. The walls of the emphysematous spaces often contain large amounts of black pigment. Inflammation around bronchus and bronchioles and in the septa is common. In severe centriacinar emphysema, the distal acinus may be involved. Centriacinar emphysema occurs in heavy smokers with resemblance to the so-called coal workers' pneumoconiosis.<br><br>(4) Panacinar or panlobular emphysema contains acinus that is uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. It tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the bases. This type is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin (&#945;1-AT) deficiency.<br><br>(5) Paraseptal or distal acinar emphysema contains acinus whose proximal portion is normal but the distal part is dominantly involved. The emphysema is more striking adjacent to the pleura. It occurs adjacent to areas of fibrosis or scarring, and is usually more severe in the upper half of the lungs. The characteristic findings are of multiple, continuous, enlarged airspaces from less than 0.5 mm to more than 2.0 cm in diameter, sometimes forming cyst-like structures.<br><br>(6) In irregular emphysema, the acinus is irregularly involved, and is almost invariably associated with scarring. Thus, it may be the most common form of emphysema but is usually asymptomatic.<br><br>(7) The most plausible hypothesis to account for the destruction of airspaces in emphysema is the protease-antiprotease mechanism. Homozygous patients with a genetic deficiency of the protease inhibitor &#945;1-AT have a markedly enhanced tendency to develop pulmonary emphysema, which is compounded by smoking. &#945;1-AT (which is present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages) is a major inhibitor of proteases, particularly elastase, secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung. The principal antielastase activity in the serum is &#945;1-AT and the principal cellular elastase activity is derived from neutrophils (other elastases are formed by macrophages, mast cells, pancreas and bacteria). Neutrophil elastase is capable of digesting human lung, and this digestion can be inhibited by &#945;1-AT. Neutrophils are normally sequestered in the lung more in the lower zones than in upper zones, and a few gain access to the alveolar space. Any stimulus (like smoking) that increases either the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung or the release of their elastase-containing granules increases elastolytic activity. Stimulated neutrophils also release oxygen free radicals which inhibit &#945;1-AT activity.<br><br>(8) It is postulated that centriacinar emphysema in smokers is due to the smoke particles, influx of neutrophils and macrophages and increased elastase and decreased &#945;1-AT activity. In contrast, panacinar emphysema of &#945;1-AT-deficient individuals reflects total lack of antiprotease throughout the acinus and susceptibility to chronic low-level proteolysis from neutrophils in transit through the lung distribution. The predominantly lower lung distribution (where perfusion and neutrophils numbers are greatest) of panacinar emphysema is also consistent with this postulate. The upper lobe distribution of centriacinar emphysema also reflects a relative lack of serum &#945;1-AT delivery to this less perfused region.<br><br>(9) The diagnosis and classification of emphysema is based on naked eye (for hand lens) examination of lungs fixed in a state of inflation. Panacinar emphysema, when well developed, produces voluminous lungs, often overlapping the heart and hiding it when the anterior chest wall is removed. The macroscopic features of centriacinar emphysema are less impressive. The lungs may not appear particularly pale or voluminous unless the disease is well advanced. Generally the upper two thirds of the lungs are more severely affected. Large apical blebs or bullae are more characteristic of irregular emphysema secondary to scarring.<br><br>(10) The clinical manifestations of emphysema do not appear until at least one third of the functioning pulmonary tissues are incapacitated. Difficulty of breathing is usually the first symptom; it begins insidiously but is steadily progressive. In some, cough, expectoration or wheezing is the chief complaint, easily confused with asthma. Weight loss is common and may be so severe as to suggest a hidden malignant tumor. The patient is barrel-chested, with difficulty of breathing, and obviously prolonged expiration, and sits forward in a hunched-over position, attempting to squeeze the air out of the lungs with each expiratory effort. Patients have a pinched face and breathe through pursed lips. There is slowing of forced expiration.<br><br>(11) There are other uncommon types of emphysema. Compensatory emphysema or compensatory hyperinflation is used to designate dilation of alveoli but not destruction of septal walls in response to loss of lung substance elsewhere. Hyperexpansion of a lung may follow after surgical removal of a diseased lung or lobe. Senile emphysema refers to the overdistended, sometimes voluminous lungs found in the aged. These changes result from age-related alterations of the internal geometry of the lung - larger alveolar ducts and smaller alveoli - that occur without loss of elastic tissue or destruction of lung substance.<br><br>(12) Obstructive overinflation refers to the condition in which the lung expands because air is trapped within it.  A common example is subtotal obstruction by a tumor or foreign object.  Bullous emphysema refers to any form of emphysema that produces large subpleural blebs or bullae (spaces &gt; 1 cm in diameter in the distended state). They represent localized accentuations of one of the four forms of emphysema, are most often near the apex, sometimes in relation to old tuberculous scarring.<br><br>(13) The entrance of air into the connective tissue stroma of the lung is called interstitial emphysema. In most instances, alveolar tears in pulmonary emphysema provide the avenue of entrance of air into the stroma of the lung, but rarely a wound on the chest that allows air to be sucked in or a fractured rib that punctures the lung substance may underlie this disorder. Alveolar tears usually occur when there is a combination of coughing plus some obstruction in the bronchioles, producing sharply increased pressures within the alveolar sacs. Common examples are children with whooping cough; patients with obstruction to the airways by blood clots, tissue, or foreign bodies or being artificially ventilated; and individuals who suddenly inhale irritant gases.");
INSERT INTO datedge_test (id, text1, text2, text3) VALUES (4, "Leukemia<br><br>(1) The bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen are involved in hematopoiesis (blood production). These organs and tissues have been divided into myeloid tissue; which includes the bone marrow; and lymphoid tissue, consisting of the thymus gland, lymph nodes and spleen. The lymphoid stem cells give rise to the B cells and T cells of the immune system. The myeloid tissue gives rise to the different precursor cells called blast cells - including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, segmented forms, lymphoblasts, myeloblasts, promyelocytes, megakaryocytes, etc. The blast cells in turn give rise to mature red blood cells and white blood cells - the leukocytes, monocytes, platelets, neutrophils and erythrocytes that circulate in the body. Any precursor cells that predominate in the peripheral blood are considered abnormal.<br><br>(2) Leukemia is a general term for a group of neoplasms of either lymphoid or hematopoietic cell origin that present with widespread involvement of the bone marrow, usually accompanied by the presence of large numbers of tumor cells in the peripheral blood. A neoplasm is any new and abnormal growth in the tissues that may be benign or malignant. The number of circulating leukocytes is often markedly increased. The bone marrow is diffusely infiltrated with leukemic cells, often with encroachment on normal hematopoietic cell development. Consequent failure of normal leukocyte, red cell and platelet production can result in anemia, infection or hemorrhage. Infiltration of leukemic cells in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and other organs is common. Generally, leukemias are categorized to acute or chronic.<br><br>(3) Acute leukemias are characterized by a predominance of blasts and closely related cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. It is more common in children and is the most common malignancy of the pediatric age group. It has second incidence peak after age 60. There may be chromosomal translocation which is associated with poorer prognosis. Without therapeutic intervention, acute leukemia follows a short and precipitous course, marked by anemia, infection, and hemorrhage, and death occurs within 6 to 12 months. Acute leukemia may be lymphoblastic or myeloblastic.<br><br>(4) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a predominance of lymphoblasts. It occurs most often in children and is the form of leukemia that is most responsive to therapy. It is further divided into subgroups based on differences in morphology, antigenic cell-surface markers, or rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain or T-cell receptor genes.<br><br>(5) ALL encompasses a group of neoplasms composed of immature, precursor B (pre-B) or T (pre-T) lymphocytes referred to as lymphoblasts. The majority of ALLs are pre-B cell tumors that typically manifest as childhood acute leukemia with extensive bone marrow and variable peripheral blood involvement. The less common pre-T cell ALLs tend to present in adolescent males, often involving the thymus gland. Most cases occur before 15 years old with peak incidence in 4 years old.<br><br>(6) Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is characterized by a predominance of myeloblasts and early promyelocytes. It is also called acute granulocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. It occurs most frequently in adults. It responds more poorly to therapy than does ALL. It is further classified into a number of subgroups based on morphology and cytochemical characteristics.<br><br>(7) AML affects primarily adults, usually 15-39 years old. It is further subdivided into 8 categories depending on the degree of maturation of the cells. This classification is also helpful for the prognosis of AML. The diagnosis of AML is based on finding greater than 30% myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. More often, distinctive red-staining rodlike structures called Auer rods are present. AML is also associated with chromosomal translocation in chromosomes 5 and 7 or 5 and 17.<br><br>(8) ALL and AML have same clinical features. Failure of hematopoiesis is manifested by anemia, neutropenia (decreased neutrophils), and thrombocytopenia (decreased platelets). It has abrupt stormy onset, most patients present within days to a few weeks of onset of symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue mainly as a result of anemia; fever, reflecting infection caused by absence of mature leukocytes; bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia; and bone pain and tenderness due to bone marrow expansion. Generalized lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and testicular involvement are more common in ALL than AML. Headache, vomiting, and nerve palsies are also more frequent in ALL than AML. Three factors have been consistently associated with a worse prognosis: less than 2 years old, presentation in adolescence or adulthood and presence of Philadelphia chromosome.<br><br>(9) Chronic leukemias are characterized by proliferations of lymphoid or hematopoietic cells that are more mature than those of the acute leukemia. It has longer, less devastating clinical course than acute leukemia. Chronic leukemia can be lymphocytic or myelocytic.<br><br>(10) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells (almost always B cells) with widespread infiltration of the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and other organs. The leukemic cells closely resemble normal mature peripheral blood lymphocytes. Leukemic cells are incapable of differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells. Peripheral blood contains increased small, round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. The cells are fragile and susceptible to mechanical disruption, frequently disrupted in the process of making the smear, producing so-called smudge cells. Leukemic cells diffusely infiltrate the bone marrow.<br><br>(11) CLL is the most common leukemia in adults. It most often occurs in persons over age of 60 and more frequently in men. It is often asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they are nonspecific and include easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. CLL disrupts immune functions making the body susceptible to bacterial infection. The clinical course is indolent, often with few symptoms and minor disability for protracted periods. Generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and spenomegaly are common. CLL has tendency to transform to more aggressive neoplasms. Mean survival is 3 to 7 years; treatment relieves symptoms but has little effect on overall survival.<br><br>(12) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or chronic myelocytic leukemia or chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells, the precursor cells of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. CML is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome. Leukemic cells consist of myeloid (granulocytic) precursor cells, including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, and segmented forms. There are small numbers of blasts and promyelocytes. There is marked reduction in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity in the leukemic leukocyte. Patients have splenomegaly and modestly enlarged liver and lymph nodes. In most instances, it terminates in an accelerated phase (blast crisis) signalled by increasing numbers of blast cells and promyelocytes.<br><br>(13) CML is a disease primarily of adults between ages 25 and 60. The peak incidence is in middle-age group (ages 35-60). A characteristic finding is the presence of sea-blue histiocytes. Peripheral blood examination reveals marked leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count).<br><br>(14) The onset of CML is insidious, and the initial symptoms may be quite nonspecific - easy fatigability, weakness, weight loss, and anorexia (decreased appetite). Symptoms are caused by mild to moderate anemia or by hypermetabolism owing to increased cell turnover. Sometimes the first symptom is a dragging sensation in the abdomen caused by the extreme splenomegaly or acute onset of left-upper quadrant pain caused by spleen destruction. The course of CML is one of slow progression, and even without treatment a median survival of 3 years can be expected. After a variable period averaging 3 years, some patients enter an accelerated phase, during which there is a gradual failure of response to treatment accompanied by increasing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Within 6 to 12 months, the accelerated phase terminates in a blast crisis just like in acute leukemia. CML can be controlled during the stable phase with low-dose chemotherapy, which, however, does not prevent progression to blast crisis.", "Cardiomyopathy<br><br>(1) The human heart is composed of 4 chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium and left ventricle. Deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body enters the right atrium and passes through the tricuspid valve then to the right ventricle. Deoxygenated blood is then carried to the lungs where it is oxygenated and then back to the left side of the heart. From the lungs, oxygenated blood enters the heart on the left atrium, passes to the mitral valve then to the left ventricle and pumped to the rest of the body.<br><br>(2) Heart activity is divided into 2 phases: the diastole and systole. During diastole or ventricle relaxation, the atrium pumps blood towards the ventricles by way of the valves. During systole or ventricle contraction, the ventricle pumps out the blood from the heart to the lungs or the different body parts. The right and left side of the heart functions simultaneously. Dysfunction results when the valves are blocked or the chambers fail to pump properly. The myocardium or heart muscles together with the different chambers may also fail to function properly once enlargement and hypertrophy sets in. Hypertrophy is defined as an abnormality in an organ or a tissue as a result of an increase in size (rather than increase in number) of the individual cells.<br><br>(3) Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the myocardium that are non-inflammatory and are not associated with hypertension, congenital heart disease, valvular disease, or coronary artery disease. It is usually characterized by otherwise unexplained ventricular dysfunction.<br><br>(4) Congestive or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of cardiomyopathy. It is defined as a diminution in the contractile function of the left, right or both ventricles in the absence of pressure overload, volume overload, or coronary artery disease. The loss of cardiac muscle function results in congestive heart failure. It is characterized by dilatation of both ventricles and by both right and left-sided heart failure.<br><br>(5) DCM can be genetic or pregnancy-induced. Prolonged ethanol or alcohol abuse is the most common reversible cause of cardiomyopathy. Viral infection is also hypothesized but proof of cause is generally lacking. High doses of doxorubicin, a commonly used antitumor drug; and exposure to mercury, lead or high-dose catecholamines may result in irreversible DCM. Endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism; metabolic disorders like elevated calcium; and prolonged arrhythmias may also lead to DCM but can easily be reversed once the offending condition is resolved. Hemoglobin disorders like sickle cell anemia and genetic abnormalities may also lead to irreversible DCM.<br><br>(6) DCM is characterized by progressive myocardium hypertrophy, dilation and contractile (systolic) dysfunction. The heart is usually heavy, weighing two to three times the normal and large and flabby, with dilation of all chambers. Most muscle cells are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei.<br><br>(7) Chest pain may occur in the absence of obstructive coronary disease. The cause of chest pain may be excessive oxygen demands of an enlarged, thin-walled ventricle with high wall stress. DCM may occur at any age, including in childhood, but it commonly affects those 20 to 60 years old. It presents with slowly progressive congestive heart failure, but patients may slip precipitously from a compensated to a decompensated state. Death is usually attributable to progressive heart failure or arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is defined as loss of normal and regular rhythm of heart beat or contraction. The offending agent should be removed and at times, heart transplant is recommended.<br><br>(8) DCM is diagnosed using any of the following: electrocardiography (ECG), chest x-ray, echocardiography (2D-echo), or cardiac catheterization. ECG may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy and heart blocks. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged heart, and congestion. 2D-echo may reveal dilated and poorly contacting left and right ventricles.<br><br>(9) Restrictive cardiomyopathy is caused by infiltrative processes within the myocardium that result in stiffening of the heart muscle, which interferes with pumping action that usually results into right and left-sided heart failure. The restrictive cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases in which the composition of the myocardium has changed so that it becomes stiffer. The increased stiffness of the myocardium restricts left ventricular filling, reducing blood volume output and increasing left ventricular filling pressure.<br><br>(10) It is a disorder characterized by a primary decrease in ventricular compliance, resulting in impaired ventricular filling during diastole, the contractile (systolic) function of the left ventricle is usually unaffected. The ventricles are of approximately normal size or slightly enlarged, the ventricular cavities are not usually dilated, and the myocardium is firm. Symptoms of both left and right-sided heart failure are present though the symptoms of right-sided heart failure are usually more prominent.<br><br>(11) ECG may also show abnormalities. Chest x-ray may show signs of congestion with normal heart size because even when left ventricular systolic function fails in the later stages of the disease, the restriction to blood filling prevents cardiac dilatation. 2D-echo shows thickening of left and right ventricles though their size remains normal. The left and right atriums are both increased in size.<br><br>(12) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is characterized grossly by hypertrophy of the ventricular wall, especially the interventricular septum. The interventricular septum is the wall between both right and left ventricle. It is characterized microscopically by disoriented and tangled myocardial fibers. It may result in left ventricular outflow obstruction, placing the patient in danger of syncope and even sudden death.<br><br>(13) HOCM is a disorder in which the interventricular septum hypertrophies excessively. The hypertrophied septum and the mitral valve produce left ventricular outflow obstruction. During systole, a low-pressure zone may develop as blood flow accelerates through the narrowed area between the septum and the mitral valve, generating a Bernoulli Effect. Thus, the mitral valve is drawn into the septum leading to outflow obstruction. The septum itself shortens very little during systole. Because the septum does not shorten, it cannot thicken. Therefore, it is the mitral valve that plays the active role in creating the obstruction.<br><br>(14) HOCM is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy, abnormal diastolic filling, and intermittent left ventricular outflow obstruction. The heart is heavy, muscular, and hypercontracting. It is primarily diastolic. The essential feature is massive myocardial hypertrophy without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern is said to be disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum as compared with the free wall of the left ventricle, frequently called asymmetric septal hypertrophy.<br><br>(15) HOCM is also known to be genetic in origin with autosomal dominant expression. There is reduced chamber size and poor compliance due to the impaired diastolic filling of the massively hypertrophied left ventricle. HOCM is often associated with arrhythmias and is one of the most common causes of sudden unexplained death in young athletes. Patients usually complain of chest pain which may occur at rest and is not always related to exercise. Loss of consciousness or syncope usually occurs after exercise as a result of reduced left ventricular size and consequent increased obstruction in outflow.<br><br>(16) ECG is almost always abnormal showing left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. 2D-echo establishes the diagnosis which reveals asymmetric septal hypertrophy with or without obstruction. There is no conclusive evidence that surgical relief of obstruction in HOCM may prolong life. Thus, medical therapy is used first in an attempt to improve symptoms.", "Gender Identity Disorder<br><br>(1) Gender identity is a psychological state that reflects a person's sense of being male or female. It develops in most persons by the age of 2 or 3 years and usually corresponds to one's biological sex. Gender role is the external behavioural pattern that reflects a person's inner sense of 'I am a male' or 'I am a female'. Gender identity disorders involve the persistent desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the other sex and extreme discomfort with one's assigned sex and gender role.<br><br>(2) According to the fourth text revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), gender identity disorder is a heterogenous group of disorders whose common feature is a strong and persistent preference for the status and role of the opposite sex. These disorders may be manifested verbally, or non-verbally, in cross-sex behaviour. The affective component of gender identity disorder is commonly referred to as gender dysphoria, defined as discontent with one's biological sex, the desire to possess the body of the opposite sex, and the wish to be regarded as a member of the opposite sex.<br><br>(3) The extreme forms of gender identity disorder is collectively referred to as transsexualism which commonly involves attempts to pass as a member of the opposite sex in the society and to obtain hormonal and surgical treatment to simulate the phenotype of the opposite biological sex. A person with gender identity disorder may be attracted to persons of the opposite sex, of the same sex, or of both sexes or may not experience sexual attraction to others.<br><br>(4) There are four major criteria for gender identity disorder: a strong and persistent cross-gender identification (not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex); persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex; the disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition; and the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.<br><br>(5) Strong and persistent cross gender-identification in children is manifested by four or more of the following: (1) repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex; (2) in boys, preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire, in girls, insistence on wearing only stereotypical masculine clothing; (3) strong and persistent preferences for cross-sex roles in make-believe play or persistent fantasies of being the other sex; (4) intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex; and (5) strong preference for playmates of the other sex. In adolescents and adults, the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, frequent passing as the other sex, desire to live or be treated as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the other sex.<br><br>(6) Persistent discomfort with his or her sex in children is manifested as follows: in boys, assertion that his penis or testes are disgusting or will disappear or assertion that it would be better not to have a penis, or aversion toward rough and-tumble play and rejection of male stereotypical toys, games, and activities; in girls, rejection of urinating in a sitting position, assertion that she has or will grow a penis, or assertion that she does not want to grow breasts or menstruate, or marked aversion toward normative feminine clothing.<br><br>(7) There is also a sub-category called: gender identity disorder not otherwise specified which is reserved for persons who cannot be classified as having a gender identity disorder with the characteristics described above. Three examples are: persons with intersex conditions and gender dysphoria; adults with transient, stress-related cross dressing behaviour; and persons who have a persistent preoccupation with castration or penectomy without a desire to acquire the sex characteristics of the other sex.<br><br>(8) Intersex conditions include a variety of syndromes in which persons have gross anatomical aspects of the opposite sex such as Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome and pseudohermaphroditism. In Turner's syndrome, one sex chromosome is missing (XO chromosome). The result is absence or minimal development of the gonads, and no significant sex hormones are produced. The sexual tissues remain in a female resting state. They often show other signs, such as webbed neck, low hairline margin, and short stature.<br><br>(9) Klinefelter's syndrome patients (usually XXY chromosome) have a male habitus under the influence of the Y chromosome, but the effect is weakened by the presence of the second X chromosome. Although patients are born with a penis and testes, the testes are small and infertile, and the penis may also be small. Beginning with adolescence, some patients develop gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) and other feminine-appearing contours. Their sexual desire is usually weak. Many patients have a wide variability of psychopathology, ranging from emotional instability to mental retardation. In pseudohermaphroditism, infants are born with ambiguous genitals. This is considered an obstetrical emergency. Sex assignment is done based on the genitalsâ€™ appearance at birth. True hermaphroditism is characterized by the presence of both testes and ovaries in the same person.<br><br>(10) Cross-dressing defined as dressing in clothes of the opposite sex is a gender identity disorder if it is transient and related to stress. If the disorder is not stress-related, persons who cross-dress are classified as having transvestic fetishism. An essential feature of transvestic fetishism is that it produces sexual excitement. Stress-related cross-dressing may sometimes produce sexual excitement, but it also reduces a patient's tension and anxiety. Patients may harbour fantasies of cross-dressing but act them out only under stress. Male adult cross-dressers may have the fantasy that they are female, in whole or in part. Cross-dressing is commonly known as transvestism and the cross-dresser as a transvestite. Cross-dressing differs from transsexualism in that the patients have no persistent preoccupation with getting rid of their primary and secondary sex characteristics and acquiring the sex characteristics of the other sex.<br><br>(11) The category of preoccupation with castration is reserved for men and women who have a persistent preoccupation with castration or penectomy without a desire to acquire the sex characteristics of the opposite sex. They are clearly uncomfortable with their assigned sex and live a life driven by the fantasy of what it would be like to be a different gender. They may be asexual and lack sexual interest in either men or women.<br><br>(12) In contrast to DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10 lists five gender identity disorders: transssexualism, dual-role transvestism, gender identity disorder of childhood, other gender identity disorders, and gender identity disorders, unspecified.<br><br>(13) In transsexualism, the individual desires to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to make his or her body as congruent as possible with the preferred sex through surgery and hormonal treatment, the transsexual identity has been present persistently for at least 2 years and is not a symptom of another mental disorder or associated with chromosome abnormality.<br><br>(14) In dual-role transvestism, the individual wears clothes of the opposite sex in order to experience temporarily membership of the opposite sex, there is no sexual motivation for the cross-dressing, and the individual has no desire for a permanent change to the opposite sex.<br><br>(15) Gender identity of childhood is manifested by persistent and intense distress about being a boy or a girl, and a stated desire to be of the opposite sex, or insists that he or she is a girl or boy, respectively. The disorder is present before puberty for at least 6 months. The child may also present with the following: persistent marked aversion to normative gender clothing insistence on wearing stereotypical clothing of the opposite sex; and/or persistent repudiation of his/her anatomical structures.");
